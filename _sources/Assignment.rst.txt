=================================
Assignment or bi-partite matching
=================================

An important special case of the
minimum cost flow problem and, in particular, the transportation problem, is the
so called *assignment* problem on bi-partite graphs,
also called *matching* problem. In its basic formulation, this is just
a transportation model in which the cardinality of the set of origin
nodes is exactly equal to that of the destination ones, and the both
production as well as demand are equal to one.
 
A  feasible matching consists of a subgraph in which
each node in the origin node set is adjacent to one and only one node
of the destination set. In
practice an assignment, or matching, is a one-to-one correspondence between
the nodes of the bi-partition. If a weight, or cost, is associated
with each arc,
the problem becomes that  of finding the minimum total cost feasible
assignment.

If  there were more origin than destination nodes,
the model might be employed to find a one-to-one correspondence  between a
subset of sources  with the destination nodes.
It is of course possible to  consider situations  in which the bi-partite graph is not
complete, i.e. not all source nodes are connected with all
target nodes. In these cases it is not generally granted  a priori that the
assignment problem has a solution.
 
In the most common case, in which origin nodes are as many as the destinations
the assignment model might  be formulated as follows:


.. role:: model
   :class: smallcaps
	   
:model: Assignment (or bi-partite matching)

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{Orig}`: set of origin nodes
   * :math:`\set{Dest}`: set of destination nodes
   * :math:`\set{E} \subseteq \set{Orig} \times \set{Dest}`: set of
	directed arcs

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|
   
   * :math:`\param{Cost}_{ij}`: cost of matching node :math:`i \in \set{Orig}` and
     node :math:`j \in \set{Dest}`

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\var{f}_{ij}`: flow from node :math:`i` to node :math:`j`. 

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * A single input arc for each destination node:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	
	\begin{align*}
        \sum_{i \in \set{Orig}: (i, j) \in \set{E}} \var{f}_{ij} &=
        1 & \forall \, j \in \set{Dest}
	\end{align*}
	
   * A single arc  from each source node:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	
	\begin{align*}
        \sum_{j \in \set{Dest}: (i, j) \in \set{E}} \var{f}_{ij} &= 1
        & \forall \, i \in \set{Orig}
	\end{align*}

   * \item Non negativity:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\var{f}_{ij} &\geq 0 & \forall \, (i, j) \in \set{E}
	\end{align*}

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   * Minimization of the total matching cost:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{Cost}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij}
	\end{align*}

In this model, since the supply and demand of each node
are equal to one and the model is a special case of 
of the transportation one, in each basic feasible solution all variables will 
be    binary. Binary variables :math:`\var{f}_{ij}` correspond to the 
indicator variables of  a selection of arcs.

The particular structure of the assignment problem makes it
possible to design specialized algorithms which are by far
more efficient than the simplex. If we consider an example of a problem
with one thousand nodes in each element of the
bi-partition, the linear formulation just introduced would require
one million variables, of which only one thousand would be
non-zero in the optimal solution.
 
An apparently minor variant of the assignment problem
concerns models based on non-bipartite graphs: as an example, 
consider the problem of defining a calendar
of tennis matches, on which it is necessary to  pair players in
order to  optimize some function (e.g., the audience): in this case there exist no 
natural bi-partition of players. The model can be
formulated in very similar way:


:model: Non bi-partite matching

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{V}`: set of nodes
   * :math:`\set{E} \subseteq \set{V} \times \set{V}`: set of
     arcs (not directed)

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|
   
   * :math:`\param{Cost}_{e}`: cost of matching nodes :math:`i \in \set{V}` and
     :math:`j \in \set{V}`, with :math:`e = \{i,j\}`

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\var{f}_{e}`: match between the nodes of
     arc :math:`e \in \set{E}`. 

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * A single arc is incident to each node:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	
	\begin{align*}
        \sum_{e  \in \set{E}: i \in e} \var{f}_{e} &=
        1 & \forall \, i \in \set{V}
	\end{align*}
	

   * \item Binary variables:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\var{f}_{e} & \in \{0,1\} & \forall \, e \in \set{E}
	\end{align*}

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   * Minimization of the total matching cost:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\min \sum_{e \in E} \param{Cost}_{e} \var{f}_{e}
	\end{align*}

 
In this case the problem is no longer a special case of the 
general  minimum cost network flow problem, and the integrality of
basic feasible solutions, with this formulation, can no longer be
guaranteed. However,
the problem can be very efficiently solved 
through specialized algorithms  :cite:`Edmonds65`.
 
Bi-partite assignment models  find application  in many different applications.
One of  the  classical ones concerns the problem of deciding, given a group of students
and a set of projects, how to assign students to each
project; the cost might be a preference index expressed by each
student  on the  individual projects. Another direct application is 
that of assigning some tasks to a group of persons, knowing that
assigning a specific task to a person has a  cost for the company (e.g.
example, the cost of training) or requires some amount of time which
is different for different pairings.

:application: :index:`Shift/staff matching`

Many organizations, like, e.g., hospitals, assign shifts to their
staff so that a sufficient coverage of the required personnel type is
available in every period of the planning horizon. The problem of
optimally  planning shifts for a company is, as anyone can easily imagine,
a very complex one; a simplified version of the problem of deciding
which type, and in which quantity, of shifts to plan will be the
subject of a specific model, called covering, which will be presented in 
chapter :ref:`set-covering`.  Once the required shifts have been established
it is necessary to proceed with assignin each unit of personnel to the
scheduled shift. A possible implementation in this case might be that
of presenting to each  employee
the list of shifts  to be  covered:
each worker, according to personal needs and preferences, will
indicate a  preference or a ranking. As an example, value 1 will be
assigned to  the preferred shift, 2 on the second choice and so on up
to the least liked shift. These preference indices can be
considered as costs in an assignment problem between the nodes
"employee" and the nodes "shift". The optimal solution of the
assignment problem
will then provide a worker / shift match which
maximizes the total preference index given by the sum of the
individual preferences.

As an example, with the following assignment model:

.. tabs::
   
   .. group-tab:: AMPL
      .. code-block:: ampl
      .. literalinclude:: AMPL/assignment.mod
	 :caption: assignment.mod
      
   .. group-tab:: Julia
      .. code-block:: Julia
      .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	 :caption: assignment.jl

and the following data

.. tabs::
   
   .. group-tab:: AMPL
      .. code-block:: ampl
      .. literalinclude:: AMPL/assignment.dat
	 :caption: assignment.dat
      
   .. group-tab:: Julia
      .. code-block:: Julia
      .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	 :caption: assignment.dat
 
the solver determines the following optimal solution:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \begin{array}{l|ccccccc}
      & \multicolumn{7}{c}{Shifts} \\
     & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
     A&  &   & 2  &   &   &   &   \\
     B&  &   &    &   &   & 1 &   \\
     C&1 &   &   &   &   &   &   \\
     D&  & 1 &   &   &   &   &   \\
     E&  &   &   & 1 &   &   &   \\
     F&  &   &   &   & 4 &   &   \\
     G&  &   &   &   &   &   & 1 \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}


where we choose to represent the cost of the optimal assignment in the
rows and columns of the resulting matching. As it can be seen, 5 out
of the 7 workers obtain their preferred choice, one the second one and  one receives the
fourth choice. Had we proceeded in a myopic, priority-based, way
assigning the first available choice to A, then to B, and so on, we
would have obtained a non optimal assignment:


.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \begin{array}{l|ccccccc}
      & \multicolumn{7}{c}{Shifts} \\
     & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
     A&  &   &   &   &   &   & 1 \\
     B&  &   &   &   &   & 1 &   \\
     C&1 &   &   &   &   &   &   \\
     D&  & 1 &   &   &   &   &   \\
     E&  &   &   & 1 &   &   &   \\
     F&  &   &   &   & 4 &   &   \\
     G&  &   & 7  &   &   &   &   \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}

The solution determined with this model minimizes the sum of the
penalties associated with each choice. This  could
lead to quite unbalanced combinations, in which many receive the
favorite choice against a few who get a quite bad one.
As an example, a slightly sub-optimal solution for this example with
the following assignments

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \begin{array}{l|ccccccc}
      & \multicolumn{7}{c}{Shifts} \\
     & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
     A&  &   & 2  &   &   &   &   \\
     B&  &   &    &   & 3 &   &   \\
     C&1 &   &   &   &   &   &   \\
     D&  & 1 &   &   &   &   &   \\
     E&  &   &   & 1 &   &   &   \\
     F&  &   &   &   &   &3  &   \\
     G&  &   &   &   &   &   & 1 \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}

although the total cost becomes 12, instead of the optimal 11, the
assignment is more fair.
If we are looking for a fair assignment the model needs to be changed
(and it loses the characteristics of being a network flow one).

However, without changing the underlying model, a more equitable
assignment might be found with a few tricks. A simple way
would be to change the weights
increasing the penalty associated with worse choices: as an 
example, the costs associated with each pair might be squared. In this
example, squaring the penalties, a solution equivalent to the last one
above, with sum of penalties equal to 12, would be obtained.

Another possibility to avoid assigning too bad shifts to a small group
of workers, would be to cancel the corresponding arcs. E.g., we might
cancel all arcs whose weight is 4 or more. There is a risk of
infeasibility, but if a feasible solution exists, it will have quite a
fair distribution of duties.

A model in which, explicitly, we would like to minimize the cost of
the worst assignment would lead to a "minimax" model, with the objective

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \max_{(i, j) \in \set{Arcs}} \{\param{Cost}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij} \}
   \end{align*}
  
The linear formulation of minimax models is quite simple and
will be presented in paragraph :ref:`Fair Assignment <fair_assignment>`; however
the transformations necessary 
to convert the minimax model into a  linear one will destroy the
integrality property enjoyed by pure network flow models.
 
A simpler modification, often useful in
these kind of applications, is connected with the need to assign more than
one person to a shift or to a duty. It is indeed trivial to change the
model to include different requirements for each shift. The resulting model
becomes a  transportation one, where the source nodes  always have a
unit balance, while destination nodes have a balance equal to the demand.

:application: :index:`School bus driver assignment`

   Consider  the problem
   of  assigning drivers to buses for the transport of
   school children; in this particular case, an assignment of
   drivers is required for two distinct working shifts, corresponding
   to the entrance and exit of children from school. It is assumed then
   that  :math:`n` vehicles in the morning and in the afternoon have
   to be assigned.
   Different vehicles will follow different routes,
   with different duration, to collect and deliver 
   children. A driver  assigned to two shifts (one in the morning,
   the other in the afternoon) will be paid  based on the overall duration
   of the two routes. In particular, it can be assumed that
   the driver's duties correspond to a fixed salary, for working hours up
   to a duration  :math:`D`, plus, possibly, an extra payment for
   each additional hour of driving in the same day.

   We can model this problem as a graph whose nodes are 
   morning and  afternoon routes. It  is not
   important  which driver will drive which route, but rather how
   to match morning and afternoon  runs at the minimum total cost.
 
   Let :math:`d_{i}` denote the estimated duration of
   route :math:`i`:  the cost associated with an arc :math:`(i, j)` will be 

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \[
      \max \{0, d_{i} + d_{j} -D \},
      \]
   
   which represents the number of overtime hours that the company
   must pay to a driver who is assigned shift :math:`i`  in the
   morning and  shift :math:`j` in the afternoon. The following data file shows
   can be taken as an example:

   .. tabs::
   
      .. group-tab:: AMPL
	 .. code-block:: ampl
	 .. literalinclude:: AMPL/sc-bus.dat
	    :caption: sc-bus.dat
      
      .. group-tab:: Julia
	 .. code-block:: Julia
	 .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	    :caption: sc-bus.dat
 

   Morning and afternoon routes have different durations;
   the last part of the file contains the definition of the
   overtime cost for every pair of routes. Running a linear optimization
   solver on this simple example, the following solution is obtained:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \begin{array}{ccc}
      AM & PM & Cost \\ \hline
      AM1 & PM2  & 2 \\
      AM2 & PM5 & 0 \\
      AM3 & PM7 & 0 \\
      AM4 & PM4 & 0 \\
      AM5 & PM1 & 1 \\
      AM6 & PM6 & 0 \\
      AM7 & PM8 & 0 \\
      AM8 & PM3 & 0 \\
      \hline
      \end{array}
      \end{align*}

   with a total number of overtime hours equal to 3.
   This problem actually lends itself to a very simple solution,
   through sorting. It s in fact possible to show
   that optimal assignment can be obtained by sorting
   morning routes in non decreasing order and afternoon ones in non
   increasing order.
   An optimal pairing can then be obtained from these two lists. In the example:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \begin{array}{ccc}
      AM & PM & Cost \\ \hline
      AM2  & PM1 & 1 \\
      AM5 & PM2 & 1 \\
      AM8 & PM3 & 0 \\
      AM1 & PM5 & 1 \\
      AM3 & PM6 & 0 \\
      AM6  & PM7 & 0 \\
      AM7 & PM8 & 0 \\
      AM4 & PM4 & 0 \\ \hline
      \end{array}
      \end{align*}
   
   Although different from the one obtained before, it has clearly the
   same objective function value. 

The application  just presented  is known in the literature under the name
of :index:`scheduling two machines in series`;  in fact the problem
corresponds to that of choosing how to sort 
parts  to be  assembled in a production line composed of two stages in
series.


It is worth also to make an observation on  applications like this
one, where  a specialized an efficient solution algorithm is
available.
Of course, were we interested in just solving this problem, it would
be useless and inefficient to rely on a general purpose optimization
solver and to the linear modeling expression. However it is very
frequently the case in which a similar problem is a small part of a
much larger and complex optimization one. In this case, when the main
variables are linked to other variables in the problem, it is no more
possible to rely on solution algorithms which can be applied only to a
part of the model. To make this point clear, assume that not only we
have to pair morning with afternoon shifts, but also we need to take
into account drivers' preferences like, e.g., routes which they do not
wish to cover, or bounds in the number of overtime hours they are
willing to offer. In this case it is likely that the above problem
would be a part of a larger one in which pairing decisions are
influenced by assignment of pairs to workers.

:application: :index:`Moving object tracking`

   Another application of bi-partite matching corresponds to
   the determination of the direction of movement of
   objects in sequential frames. Assume that two frames, or pictures
   taken at within a short time interval one from the other, are
   available.
   The problem is to pair the two frames matching objects  in order to
   be able to track their position in time and space.
   It can be seen that this problem is indeed an assignment one, in
   which nodes of the sets in the bi-partite graph are associated to
   objects in the two frames. Arcs connect objects in two different
   frames, with the assumption that if an arc is chosen then the two
   associated objects will be paired in the two frames.
   If, as it is assumed here, the two frames have been obtained in a
   quite short time interval, it is reasonable to assume that objects
   did not move too much. So it is natural to associate to each arc a
   cost equal to the euclidean distance between points in the two frames. 
   In this case we
   assume that the  objects are  moving at a speed which is low with
   respect to the frame rate. Let
   :math:`(X_i^k,Y_i^k)` be the coordinates of object :math:`i` in
   frame :math:`k \in \{1,2\}`. The cost associated to an arc
   between objects :math:`i,j` can be defined as

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \var{c}_{ij} & = \sqrt{(X_i^1-X_j^2)^2 + (Y_i^1-Y_j^2)^2}
      \end{align*}
      
   and the assignment model can be employed to find the matching which
   minimizes the overall sum of euclidean displacements.

   As an example, consider the following picture:

   .. tikz::

      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=8]
      \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid[step=0.1] (1,1);
      \foreach \name / \x / \y in {1/0.012/0.236,

      \node[draw,circle,blue] (A\name) at (\x,\y) {};
      \end{tikzpicture}

   which represents the first frame, and the following one:

   .. tikz::

      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=8]
      \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid[step=0.1] (1,1);
      \foreach \name / \x / \y in {1/0.034/0.123,

      20/0.973/0.929}
      \node[draw,circle,orange] (B\name) at (\x,\y) {};
      \end{tikzpicture}

   for the second one. Solving the assignment model the following
   tracking is obtained:

      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=8]
      \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid[step=0.1] (1,1);

   This matching result was obtained by preparing a data file suitable
   for the assignment model, as it can be seen in the following
   example:


   .. tabs::
   
      .. group-tab:: AMPL
	 .. code-block:: ampl
	 .. literalinclude:: AMPL/tracking.dat
	    :caption: tracking.dat
      
      .. group-tab:: Julia
	 .. code-block:: Julia
	 .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	    :caption: tracking.dat

   As it can be seen, e.g., in the AMPL data file, some trick had to be
   used in order to be able to compute the cost coefficients. In a
   more advanced setting, like, e.g., in the AMPLpy python/AMPL
   interface, operations on data frames could be much more easily and
   efficiently performed. Of course different matching solutions will
   be found using a different distance function.
 
      
   The model just seen is based on the assumption that the number of
   objects in the two frames does not change; if this is not the case,
   simple modifications  would be needed in order to allow 
   the case of objects which  are present in a frame, but absent
   in the other one.

:application: :index:`Determination of the karyotype of chromosomes`
	      
   The *karyotype*
   is defined as a set of shape characteristics,
   size, number and properties of the chromosomes of a species. In
   humans, as an example, there are 23 pairs of  chromosomes,
   22 of which are identical while one, for the male, contain the X-Y pair.
   Each group of chromosomes has its own characteristics,
   with different biological properties. In some clinical tests
   the analysis and identification of all 46 chromosomes is required.
   This analysis is done through the identification of a set of
   characteristic parameters, such as, for example, the length,
   or the set of so-called "band features".
   Recognition is not error-free;
   however, for each chromosome, it is possible to compute the
   probability :math:`p_{ij}` that the :math:`i` -th
   chromosome observed belongs to class :math:`j`. Given this
   probability it is then possible to find the assignment which minimizes
   the expected number wrong assignments:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \begin{align*}
      \min \sum_{i = 1}^{46} \sum_{j = 1}^{23} (1-p_{ij}) \var{f}_{ij} \\
      \sum_{j = 1}^{23} \var{f}_{ij} & = 1 & \forall \, i & = 1,46 \\
      \sum_{i = 1}^{46} \var{f}_{ij} & = 2 & \forall \, j & = 1,23 \\
      \var{f}_{ij} & \geq 0
      \end{align*}
   
   This model is not strictly an assignment but more correctly a
   transportation one.
   The model above is for the case of a female cell, while for the male
   it should be extend to take into consideration the X-Y pair.
