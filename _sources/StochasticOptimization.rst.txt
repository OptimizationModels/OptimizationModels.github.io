Uncertainty modeling: Stochastic optimization models
====================================================

Dealing with unpredictable events is very hard, but worthwhile: many
decision can be significantly improved if uncertainty and, in
particular, variability is taken into correct account. The field is
very large and indeed complex, and it involves modeling aspects as
well as algorithmic and deep theoretical analysis. In these pages we
will just scrap the surface of this important theme, mainly with the
intent of showing that it is indeed possible to take into
consideration stochastic events and  also to show that, in some cases,
the resulting models are still linear ones, obtained thanks to
modification of standard, deterministic models.

Probabilistic constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
In many applications  some data are not
known with precision but, at best, an assumption can be made on a 
probabilistic model. In other words, some data can be viewed as the 
realization of a random variable. In these cases the traditional constraints
cannot be used anymore. Consider the following  case:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \leq b 
   \end{align*}
   
where :math:`b` is  a random variable whose
probability distribution

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   F_{b} (y): = P (b \leq y)
   \]

is assumed to be known.

When, as in this case, :math:`b` is a random variable, the constraint
is no more well defined, since its right hand side is no more  a
constant, but a function (recall that a 
:index:`random variable` is a function from the event space with real values).

Often in these cases we can subsitute the deterministic constraint
with a probabilistic one, called a :index:`chance constraint`:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   P \left (\sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \leq b \right) \geq \param{\beta} 
   \end{align*}
   
where :math:`\param{\beta} \in [0,1]` $.
This constraint corresponds to the
request that the constraint is satisfied with probability at least
equal to  :math:`\beta`,  a given threshold. In general, such a constraint is
nonlinear and often it is impossible to write it in an explicit form. In
some cases, however, it is possible to convert it to 
an equivalent regular (deterministic) constraint. This happens in
particular in  the present case, that is,  when the only random
variable
is the right hand side. In fact, using the definition of
probability distribution, and assuming for simplicity that :math:`b` 
is a *continuous random variable* and, thus, that its distribution
function is invertible, we obtain:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
      P \left (\sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \leq b \right) & = 1-P
      \left (b <\sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \right)   \\
      & = 1-P \left (b \leq \sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \right)  \\
      & = 1-F_{b} \left (\sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \right)  
      \geq \param{\beta} & \text{iff}  \\
      \sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j & \leq F_{b}^{-1} (1- \param{\beta})
   \end{align*}
 
The right-hand side of this equation is 
deterministic, so the probabilistic constraint has been transformed
into a
traditional (and linear) constraint. As an example, if the
distribution of :math:`\param{b}` can be assumed to be
uniformly distributed  between two valuesâ€‹  :math:`\param{b}_{\ell}`
and :math:`\param{b}_{u}`, after easy calculations we can  deduce the
deterministic equivalent constraint

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \leq \param{\beta} \param{b}_{\ell} +
   (1- \param{\beta}) \param{b}_u 
   \end{align*}
 
If the term :math:`b`  was, instead, exponentially distributed with
parameter :math:`\lambda`:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   P (b \leq y) & = 1 - \exp \left (- \param{\lambda} y \right)
   \end{align*}

for which it is easy to see that

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   F^{-1} (x) & = - \frac{1} {\param{\lambda}} \log (1 - x)
   \end{align*}
   
then   the  deterministic equivalent form of the
constraint would become

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_j \param{a}_j \var{x}_j \leq - \frac{1} {\param{\lambda}} \log (1 - \param{\beta}).
   \end{align*}
 
In the frequent case in which the random variable is assumed to be
normal (gaussian) the procedure is exactly the same, although we need
to resort to a numerical approximation of the inverse gaussian
distribution, whose analytical expression is not available. 

Of course the situation becomes significantly more complex when  more
than one
coefficient of the same constraint (or of different constraints) is
random; even more complex is the case in which it is not possible to
assume stochastic independence among these variables.
In these cases, it is often impossible to obtain a closed form of a
deterministic equivalent of the original constraint.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Stochastic linear optimization models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not possible, in this volume, to present even  a very 
superficial analysis of the probabilistic  optimization models, even
in the linear case.
In this section we will just introduce 
elementary models from which it will be possible to understand how, in some cases, it is
possible to deal with stochastic decision problems using traditional
optimization  models of the kind 
presented in this volume and how to  solve them with standard 
optimization tools. Of course, this is not always possible: in fact,
in general,
the optimization models which arise when 
uncertainty is present can only be transformed  into complex nonlinear
optimization models.

Consider  any of the  problems described  up to here
in the volume: as a typical case, consider a problem of product mix
problem, as described in section :ref:`_section:prodmix`.
Assume, differently fro what has been done there, that the demand for
a product is not known a priori but can at best be
estimated assuming that a finite set of possible scenarios might
happen in the future. As an example, assume that a pessimistic scenario,a
neutral, and an  optimistic one are the only possibilities we can
foresee.
In cases like this one, in which uncertainty is linked to a finite set
of possible scenarios, it is possible to formulate a
linear optimization model in order to optimize the expected value of
the objective function (in this case, the expected gain). In order to 
be able to formulate  a deterministic equivalent model, the usual
technique consists in 
introducing additional variables whose index is  associated with each
of the possible scenarios.
 
We start with the simplest possible case: consider a situation in
which there is a finite set of different scenarios, indexed by  :math:`s \in
\set{Scenarios}` and, to each scenario, we  associate a known
probability :math:`\param{Prob}_s`. In the product mix example, let us
also assume that the demand for a certain product is a function of the
scenario: :math:`\param{Dem}_s`.
The decision on how much to produce needs to be made before knowing
which of the possible  scenarios will indeed occur, otherwise the
problem would not be a stochastic one anymore.
Thus we  have to face a
decision problem under uncertainty. As in the deterministic case,
we let :math:`\var{x}` denote  the quantity, to be produced: this
variable is not indexed by the scenario, as its value has to be
decided a priori, and in an independent way with respect to the future
actual scenario.
After the decision has been taken and the real scenario reveals
itself, it might happen that the quantity produced is insufficient, or
it might be too much. In the first case,  a penalty
:math:`\param{PenIns}`  will be paid  for each unit of product which
is  not available to 
satisfy the actual demand; in the other case, a 
penalty  :math:`\param{PenEcc}`  will be paid for the disposal of the
quantity of  product which is in
excess with respect to the demand.
As  the scenario which will occur is not known, we need to
take into account the randomness of the demand by choosing a
production  level which  minimizes a measure of the future, uncertain,
cost. It is usual to employ, in these cases, the expected value of the cost of
production, which is the sum of the cost associated to each possible scenario
weighted with the probability that such scenario will actually
occur. In this case,  the model product mix problem model will remain
exactly the same, except that in the objective function  an additional
cost term appears:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \param{PenIns} \sum_{s \in \set{Scenarios}} \max (\param{Dem}_s- \var{x}, 0)
   \param{Prob}_s & + \\
   \param{PenEcc} \sum_{s \in \set{Scenarios}} \max (\var{x} - \param{Dem}_s, 0)
   \param{Prob}_s 
   \end{align*}
 
Although the unknown variable 
appears in a non-linear (even non-differentiable) function, it is easy
to transform the expression into a fully linear one; it is possible to
see in the model  the piecewise linear structure already analyzed in
earlier in this chapter. It is indeed possible to linearize the
model by introducing additional variables associated with the different
scenarios. We can also, easily, extend the model to the usual case of
more than one product. Let :math:`\var{Surplus}_{ps}` and
:math:`\var{Slack}{ps}`
denote two new variable sets
which, in the various scenarios, represent excess production or
in default of actual demand of a specific product :math:`p`. We can
add then the following constraints to the model:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{Surplus}_{ps} & \geq \var{x}_p - \param{Dem}_{ps} & \forall \, s
   \in \set{Scenarios}, p \in \set{Products} \\
   \var{Surplus}_{ps} & \geq 0 \\
   \var{Slack}_{ps} & \geq \param{Dem}_{ps} - \var{x}_p & \forall \, s \in
   \set{Scenarios}, p \in \set{Products}  \\
   \var{Slack}_{ps} & \geq 0
   \end{align*}

and the cost term in the objective can now be reformulated  in a linear way:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{s \in \set{Scenarios}, p \in \set{Products}} \left(\var{Surplus}_{ps} \param{PenEcc} +
   \var{Slack}_{ps} \param{PenIns}\right) \param{Prob}_s 
   \end{align*}

 
As an example consider a stochastic product mix problem with the
following data:

.. code-block:: ampl 
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-prodmix.dat
   :caption: stoc-prodmix.dat

In this example there are three possible future scenarios which
influence the demand for most products (indeed, product 3 has a
constant forecasted demand, whichever the scenario). We assume that,
once a quantity is chosen for each product, the scenario becomes known
and there might be surplus or shortages. The a priori optimization
problem can be implemented as in the following model:

.. code-block:: ampl 
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-prodmix.mod
   :caption: stoc-prodmix.mod

and, when run and solved through a linear optimization solver, we
obtain the solution which maximizes the expected gain:

.. code-block:: ampl 
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-prodmix.out
   :caption: stoc-prodmix.out
 
If, as it is quite common a  practice, the demand in the different
scenarios is averaged, we might wish to solve a product mix problem
using the expected demand as it was the real one. However, differently
from the generic product mix problem introduced earlier in this
volume, we should take into account the fact that some demand might be
unsatisfied, as the limited availability of resources does not allow
to produce all what is (expected) to be required. In this case we can
modify the basic model and introduce a penalty for unsatisfied demand;
on the other hand, in a deterministic product mix model there will be
no surplus, as there would be no reason to produce in excess of the
(expected) demand. Running this model we apparently obtain a gain
which is superior to the expected one in the model seen before. But if
we fix the order quantities and compute the expected gain under the
three scenarios, we obtain the following:

.. code-block:: ampl 
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/det-prodmix.out
   :caption: det-prodmix.out
 
and we can see that indeed this produces a smaller expected gain: in
general it is not wise to substitute the expected demand with the
stochastic one. Among many other motivations, substituting the
stochastic nature of a random variable with its expectation completely
neglects the variability, which is one of the most relevant
characteristics of stochastic variables. In general, taking into
proper account probability distributions when dealing with stochastic
phenomena generates much more reliable and efficient decisions.  
Of course, this improved quality comes at the price of an increased
complexity, both in data collection (as we need to retrieve
information on all possible scenarios) and in model development.

The example just presented is very simple and concerns a deterministic
decision which must be taken now, given possible future scenarios; in
the example, no other decision is taken after the scenarios
reveals. There are indeed variables which depend on the scenario, but
these are just direct consequences of the original choices and of the
characteristics of the scenario.

In many cases, in practical applications, decisions are taken
sequentially: a first decision is taken, as we did above, then a
scenario occurs and a second-stage decision, possibly containing a
correction of the previous one, is taken; after that other scenarios
will occur, and so on. This situation frequently occurs, e.g., in
prime material procurement: in textile production, as an example, we
might need to decide now how much of some special tissue to buy right
now, taking into account long lead and transportation  times. Then,
after the buying agreement has been signed and possibly paid, some
events, like fairs or exhibitions, take place and the situation of the
future market might become less uncertain. At this point if, as an
example, it is likely that the market is ready to buy more finished
product than originally planned, new, usually more expensive, prime
material can be bought from nearby producers. This second stage
decision depends on the original one and on the scenario which has
been revealed. Eventually, the real demand is observed.

Quite a similar situation happens in agriculture. Consider the
following atficial example:

:application: :index:`Stochastic farm problem`

   This application is taken from the introductory chapters of
   :cite:`birge11` to which we address the reader interested in a good
   introduction to the theory and methods of stochastic optimization.
   Assume a farmer has a quantity of acres of land available and that a decision
   has to be taken about how much how the available land to devote to Wheat, Corn, Beans.
   This decision has to be taken now.
   In order to run the farm and feed the cattle it would be necessary to harvest a
   minimum quantity of wheat and corn (200t and 240t,
   respectively). One of the difficulties is that the exact yield
   is uncertain, due to possibly different future weather conditions;
   however, in any case, the exact future yield
   is related to the quantity of land devoted to that
   cultivation. If needed, it is always possible to buy additional wheat
   and corn, or it is possible  to sell it, if it is in excess. For what concerns
   beans, these are possibly grown only for sale (they are not needed
   for the cattle), so there is no
   minimum requirement. 

   We assume that future scenarios will be bad, average, good, and
   that the scenario will directly influence the yield of each
   product. In this simplified example, we assume prices are not
   sensible to the scenarios, although it might be interesting to add
   this possibility. The three scenarios are assumed to occur with
   equal probability. The relevant data is contained in the following
   data file:

   .. code-block:: ampl 
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-farm.dat
      :caption: stoc-farm.dat

   The model is again quite similar to a product mix. We choose to add
   an extra variable to the model whose value is the
   effective product quantity, as a function of the yield. This is not
   necessary, indeed, but just increases the readability of the
   model.
   Moreover we introduced, in the balance equation, also another
   variable, :math:`\var{ExtraSell}` to model possible extra
   production which cannot be sold, as the market is not capable of
   absorbing it. In the example, this happens for Beans, for which a
   maximum demand is imposed equal to 6000; if, based on the acres
   devoted to Beans, in a scenario the yield turns out to be more than
   this quantity, the excess production will not contribute to any
   profit in the objective function: it will thus be a waste, a pure
   cost.
   
   As it can be seen in the implementation, the main variable
   is not  indexed by the  scenario, as the decision about land
   subdivision is a *first stage* decision, to be taken now:

   .. code-block:: ampl 
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-farm.mod
      :caption: stoc-farm.mod

   After the main decision is taken and the scenario becomes known,
   the *second stage* or :index:`recourse actions` need to be taken:
   depending on the actual yield, some product quantity will be
   purchased or sold.  The constraints of the model are simply the
   request not to exceed the total available land and a set of balance
   equations for the definition of possibly excess or defect
   production, with respect to the demand. The objective function is
   the weighted average of the total gain (revenues minus costs) in
   the scenarios, weighted with the probability of each scenario.

   With these data, the optimal solution, taking into account the
   randomness of scenarios, is the following:
   
   .. code-block:: ampl 
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/stoc-farm.out
      :caption: stoc-farm.out

   It is possible to see that the second stage decision on how much to
   buy or sell is quite easily understandable: we sell excess
   production, and buy any product which is needed. So there is no
   real difficulty, in this case, in planning the second stage
   decision. What is really strategic is to be able to take these
   recourse actions into due considerations so that the initial choice
   is made in a profitable way. If we changed the conditions, e.g., to
   that of an average scenario (this is simple to obtain by letting
   the probability of this scenario to be 1), we obtain a land
   destination of 120 acres to Wheat, 80 to Corn, the remaining 300 to
   Beans, with an overproduction of 100t of Wheat to be sold. The
   profit obtainable in this case is :math:`118\,600`, which apparently is much
   more convenient that the optimal one, obtained in the stochastic
   case, :math:`108\,390`. However this is not true. If, in fact, the
   unpredictable nature of scenarios is taken into correct account,
   there is no more an advantage in using the average scenario. In
   fact, fixing the quantity of land as in the average scenario, takin
   into account the three different possibilities,   it turns out that
   the expected return will be only 
   :math:`103\,240.0154` with a loss of roughly 5\% with respect to
   the stochastic decision.
