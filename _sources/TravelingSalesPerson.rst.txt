Sequencing problems: the :index:`Traveling Salesperson Problem`
---------------------------------------------------------------

A :index:`sequencing problem` arises
when the decision maker needs to choose
the "best" ordering for a set of objects or in which sequence
to perform a set of operations. The problem consists in determining a
permutation among all feasible ones; to each  permutation 
a cost is associated, and the problem, in its basic formulation,
consists in  the search for the least cost feasible permutation.

There exist various  formulations for sequencing  problems,
the most common of which corresponds to the case where the
cost  of a permutations is given by the sum of
costs associated to contiguous pairs in the sequence.
To be more concrete, a typical sequencing problem is encountered in
transport logistics (and gives the name of :index:`traveling
salesperson`, in short, :index:`TSP`, to the model):  a driver needs to visit a set of
destinations (to deliver or collect parcels); there is no problem of
capacity. The only requirement is that every destination is visited
once and, at the end of the tour, the driver returns to the starting
base station. Thus the problem can be seen as that of sequencing the
visits, in order to spend as little as possible in the overall travel.
The total cost, in this case, is composed by the sum of the cost
incurred in moving from one destination node (or from the base
station) to the following one in the sequence, or to the base station
when the tour is terminated.

This is perhaps one of the best known and most studied research
problem in Operations Research.
The interest in this problem arises both from the fact that it
is  a problem which is very simple to describe, but
considerably complex to solve, and from the fact that the applications of the
salesman are manifold and not limited to delivery and / or problems
collection of goods.
 
A possible formalization of the problem can be obtained in
following way. Consider a directed graph whose nodes are 
cities (or customers) to be visited. We assume that the graph is
*complete*, which means that there exists an arc connecting each pair
of nodes.
Sometimes this is not the case: in a road network, as an example, only
some pairs of cities are connected directly by a road. In graphs which
are not complete, a path which goes through each node once and only
once might not exist:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0/0/0,0/2/1,1/1/2,2/0/3,2/2/4,3/1/5}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\name};
   \foreach \source / \dest in
   {0/1,1/2,3/4,4/5,2/3,2/4,3/5} 
   \draw[draw] (\source) -- (\dest); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

It is evident that, in this figure, no path exists which, starting
from node 0, goes through nodes 1-5 and back to 0 without passing more
than once over a node. By the way: a path which satisfies this
requirement is called an :index:`Hamiltonian path`.
In some applications the constraint of not
passing more than once through a node might be relaxed. In the
traveling example, it is important to visit each location to deliver
or collect parcels; however, it not forbidden to pass again through an
already visited node, on the way to a different destination. We may
thus create a new, complete, graph in which the arc between two nodes
represented a "shortest path" between the nodes itself. In other
words, a minimum cost path problem is repeatedly solved to find the
least cost route from each node to each different node in the
graph. Then, if the graph is connected, a complete graph can be
defined in which arc costs, representing optimal paths, connect each
pair of nodes. Thus it is always possible to find hamiltonian paths. 

From now on, let us assume that the graph is complete, and that costs
associated to each arc are non negative. In order to formulate the optimization problem 
we associate an indicator variable to each arc:
:math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}`. Constraints need to be defined in
such a way that this variable is equal to 1 if and
only if the route prescribes to visit node :math:`j` *immediately* after
having visited node :math:`i`. Assuming the constraints have been 
written,  the objective function is simply written, exactly in the
same way as in the minimum cost path problem:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \param{c}_{ij} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
   \end{align*}

In the above objective, :math:`E` is the set of arcs in the
graph. If nodes are denoted by :math:`V = \{0,1, \ldots, n\}`, then
:math:`E = \{(i,j) \in V \times V : i \ne j\}`.
      
For what concerns the
constraints, first observe that the tour must touch each node once;
thus, referring to a network flow problem, the total flow in and out
of each node should be equal to 1. That is, one and only one arc of
a feasible tour
will  enter each node and one and only one arc will exit from it. In
formulae:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{i \in V, i \ne j } \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & = 1 & \forall \, j \in V\\
   \sum_{j \in V, j \ne i} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & = 1 & \forall \, i
   \in V
   \end{align*}
 
It is easily recognized that the structure of these two groups of
constraints is that of matching constraints (on a graph which,
however, is not
bipartite).
Generic (non bipartite) weighted matching problems are easily solvable, and
efficient algorithms do exist.
Unfortunately these constraints, although necessary for
a feasible solution, are not  sufficient
to constrain the indicator variables to identify a single 
closed tour. The following example shows the situation:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0/0/0,0/2/1,1/1/2,2/0/3,2/2/4,3/1/5}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\name};
   \foreach \source /  \dest in {0/1,1/2,2/0}
   \path[->,ultra thick,draw,red] (\source) -- (\dest); 
   \foreach \source /  \dest in {3/4,4/5,5/3}
   \path[->,ultra thick,draw,red] (\source) -- (\dest); 
   \foreach \source /  \dest in {0/2,0/3,0/4,0/5,1/3,1/4,1/5,2/3,2/4,2/5,3/5}
   \draw[dotted,thin,draw] (\source) -- (\dest); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

In the figure, red arcs corresponds to arcs for which the indicator
variable is 1. 
All matching constraints are
satisfied by this solution, but it does not represent a feasible
solution, as the proposed path is not a unique cycle. We thus need to
introduce special purpose constraint to
eliminate :index:`sub-cycles` from feasible solutions. A sub-cycle is
a closed circuit which  does not contain the
origin node.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sub-tour elimination constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
   The first technique consists of a *labeling*  the nodes, i.e., to
   assign a new variable to each node. The idea is to
   assigns a variable to each node and, by means of suitable logical constraints,
   force the label assigned to a node to be strictly greater than that
   assigned to its direct predecessor along the path. Let us denote by :math:`\var{y}_i`
   the variable associated to node :math:`i`. Then we would like to
   impose logical constraints:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_j  > \var{y}_i 
      \end{align*}

   Assume that a sub-tour :math:`v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k, v_{k+1}=v_1` exists
   in a solution. The logical constraints above would then imply:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_{v_1v_2} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_{v_2}  >
      \var{y}_{v_1} \\ 
      \mathvar{\delta}_{v_2v_3} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_{v_3}  >
      \var{y}_{v_2} >  \var{y}_{v_1} \\
      \dots \\
      \mathvar{\delta}_{v_{k}v_1} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_{v_1}  >
      \var{y}_{v_k} >  \var{y}_{v_1}
      \end{align*}

   which is impossible. Thus it has been proven that the logical
   constraints make any tour infeasible. However it should be recalled
   that a tour should be allowed, namely one which returns to the base
   station. So it is necessary to impose the logical constraints for
   each pair of nodes, provided that the second one is not the origin:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_j  > \var{y}_i &
      \forall\,i, \forall\,j \ne 0
      \end{align*}
   
   In practice, replacing the "strictly greater" constraint with
   :math:`\geq 1`, the constraints become

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \[
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 \implies \var{y}_{j} \geq \var{y}_{i}
      +1, \quad j \ne 0
      \]
 
   To correctly formulate this constraint, we can proceed in the
   following way:
   if  :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1` , the difference
   :math:`\var{y}_{j} - \var{y}_{i}` must be greater than or equal to
   one (or to any other positive quantity). Otherwise, 
   it is necessary to find a lower bound on the same difference in such a way that the
   generated constraint is redundant. If we fix, arbitrarily,
   :math:`\var{y}_0=0`, it can be observed that

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \var{y}_j  & \leq n & \forall\, j \\
      \var{y}_j & \geq 1 & \forall\, j \ne 0
      \end{align*}

   Thus the logical constraint can be formulated as:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \var{y}_j  - \var{y}_i & \geq  \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + (1-n)
      (1-\mathvar{\delta_{ij}}) & \forall\,i \in 0,n, \forall\, j \in
      1,n  \\
      \var{y}_0  & = 0
      \end{align*}

   The addition of these constraints excludes the possibility of
   cycles not including node 0. We may also notice that it is not
   required to impose integrality constraints on the variables
   :math:`\var{y}`; in fact they might also be non integer, if
   necessary. In the above model, as the source is assigned label 0,
   the highest possible label is :math:`n` and the increment is one,
   it turns out that in any feasible solution the values of variables
   :math:`\var{y}` will be consecutive integers, i.e., a sequential
   numbering of the visited nodes.

   In the following we give a formulation of the model, using the
   formulation just introduced:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: AMPL
	 .. code-block:: ampl
	 .. literalinclude:: AMPL/tsp.mod
	    :caption: tsp.mod
   
      .. group-tab:: Julia
	 .. code-block:: Julia
	 .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	    :caption: tsp.jl

   An example of the execution of this model can be obtained, with the
   already used dataset Pistoia.dat, using the followign script:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: AMPL
	 .. code-block:: ampl
	 .. literalinclude:: AMPL/tsp.run
	    :caption: tsp.run
   
      .. group-tab:: Julia
	 .. code-block:: Julia
	 .. literalinclude:: Julia/TBD.jl
	    :caption: tsp.run

   
   which gives the following results:

   .. code-block:: ampl
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/tsp.out
      :caption: tsp.out

   The following figure reports the optimal tour (based on estimated
   travel times):

   Some comments are in order. First we can notice from the graph
   above that the path "crosses itself", which is something which
   might be considered as negative at first sight. But it should be
   reminded that the arrows represented in the figure are not
   representative of the actual path followed by the driver, but just
   are meant to represent the correct visit sequence. As an example,
   the apparent crossing close to Cutigliano is not real, as the best
   path San Marcello Pistoiese to Abetone and then Piteglio, goes
   through Cutigliano, and similarly for othe rapparent crossings.

   Another observation is the speed by which this problem is
   solved. Indeed this is a small instance. However, the fact that,
   with this formulation, it was solved in a very short CPU time, is
   not due to the formulation, but to the advanced optimization
   software employed. The solver used in the example automatically
   adds a large number of cuts (valid inequalities) to improve the
   formulation, which, in itself, is very weak. If we used, e.g., the
   CBC solver, which is already a very advanced implementation, the
   same instance would be solved in 17 seconds, with over 150000
   simplex iterations. In fact, the formulation just presented does
   not allow to solve any problem of size, say, larger than 50.
   Different formulations will be introduced later in this chapter.
   
   
   Although "weak"  from the polyhedral point of view, the constraint just presented are
   important as they allow for the formulation  of additional
   constraints, useful in many applications. In fact, in place of the unit
   increase of variable :math:`\var{y}_j`, an increase equal to, say,
   the travel time of arc :math:`(i, j)`, or the sum of the time
   spent in node :math:`i`  plus the travel time on the arc. In this
   case, variable :math:`\var{y}_j` would have the meaning of 
   the arrival time at node :math:`j`. Having this variable in the model
   easily allows to  insert temporal constraints like, e.g. requiring
   that a node must be visited in a specific time window, or requiring
   that a node is not visited before another node . An application of
   models of this kind can be thought, for example, for the
   scheduling home visits of patients by one
   medical or nursing staff. In order to implement a model of
   this kind, the logical  constraints are to be slightly modified.
   The lower bound on the difference of
   visit times of two consecutive nodes must be computed in function
   of the travel (and visit) times. For example, we might
   assume that there are an earliest start and return times, denoted
   by :math:`\param{T_{\min}}, \param{T_{\max}}`
   and, assuming that visiting a node required :math:`\param{T}_i`
   and that the travel time between two nodes is
   :math:`\param{T}_{ij}`,
   the logical constraint becomes

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \var{y}_j  - \var{y}_i & \geq  (\param{T}_i +
      \param{T}_{ij})\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
      - (\param{T_{\max}} - \param{T_{\min}})
      (1-\mathvar{\delta_{ij}}) & \forall\,i \in 0,n, \forall\, j \in
      1,n  \\
      \var{y}_0  & = \param{T_{\min}}
      \end{align*}
           
   The TSP problem has been the subject of very intense research in
   all recent years; there exist many different formulations of the
   subtour elimination constraints (see, e.g., :ref:`Oncan2009` for a
   list of 24 different models).  One of the best known formulation
   directly proceeds
   without the need for any additional labeling.
   Let  :math:`\set{S}` be any not empty subset of the set of nodes
   which does not coincide with the set of nodes: :math:`\set{S} \subset V,
   S \ne \emptyset`. In order to prevent any tour within the set
   :math:`\set{S}` it is sufficient to require that at least one arc in
   the solution exits (or enters) this set. This can be done through
   the constraint:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_ {i \in \set{S}, j \not \in
      \set{S}} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \geq 1 
      \end{align*}
 
   Such a constraint should theoretically be imposed for
   each set non empty subset of the set of nodes,
   with the exception of the whole set. However, it is easily seen
   that, for symmetry,  imposing the constraint for a set is
   equivalent to imposing the same constraint to the complementary
   set, so that we can limit the set :math:`\set{S}` to have a
   cardinality which no more than one half the number of
   nodes. Moreover, when the set is a singleton, the constraint is
   already included in the model as an assignment constraint. Thus,
   the required sub-tour elimination constraints  are:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_ {i \in \set{S}, j \not \in
      \set{S}} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &\geq 1  & \forall \, \set{S}
      \subset V: 2 \leq |S| \leq \lceil (|V|/2) \rceil
      \end{align*}
 
   Despite this reduction, the number of constraints to be added
   to the formulation is astronomical and grows exponentially fast as
   the size of the problem grows. The total number of constraints
   remains :math:`O(2^{|V|})`. It is therefore impossible
   to add all of these constraints in a formulation of the
   problem. On the other hand it can be proved that these constraints are
   rather *strong* and their addition to the original formulation
   would lead to a model whose linear relaxation is quite good.
   A possibility, exploited in most recent implementations
   is to dynamically insert only those inequalities which are violated
   in the solution of current relaxation.
   This is done in an automatic way within so-called
   :index:`Branch and Cut` implementations. The general idea is to
   solve an initial relaxation
   of the problem, and then calling  a procedure which  determines if there exists
   any of the sub-tour elimination constraints which is violated.
   If the current solution is binary, this task is quite easy, as it
   just requires to identify cycles in the current solutions: the
   nodes of any cycle which does not include the source node form a
   set :math:`\set{S}` associated to a violated inequality which can
   be added to the formulation. More complex is the case in which the
   current solution is not binary: a separation procedure needs to be
   implemented which is capable of finding a violated inequality which
   cuts off the current solution. This topic is out of the scope of
   this volume. Just as an illustrative example, if in the example
   used before we drop the labeling constraints and just solve the
   relaxed problem with only the constraints requiring one unit flow
   in and out of each node, the following solution is obtained:
   
   .. tikz::

   This solution, as it can be immediately seen, contains various
   sub-tours. Its total cost is 192.23, which is thus a lower bound on
   the optimal solution value. Adding to the formulation
   only the sub-tour elimination constraints
   associated to the 10 sub-tours in this solution, and solving the
   problem again, the following solution is found, which is again
   infeasible, but starts to get close to a single tour:

   This process can be continued and eventually the optimal solution
   is found; this happens well before having added all of the possible
   sub-tour elimination constraints. 
   

The applications of the traveling salesman model are
many. Obviously, the main application field is in transportation
logistics, where the model can be applied to sequence deliveries,
garbage collection, home care visits, ... 
Problems connected with street cleaning or snow removal are only apparently similar:
in this case it is required that each *arc* is visited at least once,
while in the traveling salesperson each *node* is visited at least
once. This problem will be shortly dealt with later on. 

Among the many applications, it is important to  recall in particular those related to
industrial production.
It is quite common, in production,  that some jobs can be worked on a
machine, or a plant, in any arbitrary ordering, within, say, a single
production period (a day, as an example).  However, it is also
frequently the case that after a job has been completed, before
starting the next one some setup is needed, and production needs to be
stopped. Frequently, this setup time depends *both* on the job just
concluded *and* on the next one. Consider, as an example, a drilling
machine: after drilling a hole in  a plate, it is necessary to change
the tool in order to drill holes of different sizes: this retooling
requires a time which depends on the relative sizes of the two
different tools to be mounted and dismounted from the machine. 
In a different environment, consider the
problem of establishing the optimal sequence of surgical operations
in an hospital: after an operation ends, and before the following one
can start, some time is needed for sterilization and for changing the
equipment in the operating room. These setup actions have a  duration
which might depend by the two surgeries involved. In these examples,
the nodes to be "visited" are the different industrial or surgical
operations; the arcs connect different operations which might be
scheduled in sequence. The cost of each arc is the amount of time
wasted in setup. The traveling salesperson solution allows us to find
how to sequence all of the operations so that the total time spent in
setup is minimized. This has great benefits in terms of productivity,
in the first case, and, in the hospital case, allows the planner to
save time on setup and have more time allowed for surgeries.
 
:application: :index:`Sequencing in industrial production`
   Consider the problem of sequencing operations in a
   machine used to color a material. Assume a list
   of jobs ready to be processed is available, each characterized by a
   set of colors. The plant is organized in such a way that, when a
   job is finished and the next one has to be prepared to start, some
   colors need possibly to be changed. This change requires a setup
   time. If colors are liquid, it might be necessary to clean the
   containers and to fill them with  a new color, or to extract the
   color container and insert a new one. In textile industries, color
   changes require dismounting a set of threads and substituting them
   with another set.  In general, the time wasted in this operation
   depends on the number of colors changed. In painting, it might also
   depend on the colors themselves, as cleaning some colors from a
   container might require different times depending on the color
   type. In this latter case, the graph of the TSP is asymmetric.
   Consider as an example the case of coloring tissues in 4 colors,
   and assume that the jobs to be worked on a day are represented by
   the following figure:

   In this figure the standard is to  process jobs in the order given
   by reading the table from left to right, top down. At the left of
   each job a number denotes the number of colors to be changed before
   that job begins. For the first job this number is 4, as,
   considering the last job, all of the colors need to be changed. The
   second job in this sequence has a setup cost 2, as it can be seen
   that from job 1 to job 2 only two colors have to be changed, while
   blue and brown can be left unchanged. It should be clear how to
   compute setup times for all pairs of jobs. Using this sequence,
   which was built using a lexicographic ordering of job colors, a
   total of 35 color changes is needed.

   If we run the TSP model with the data corresponding to this job
   set, the following sequence of jobs is obtained:

       \patt{blue}{brown}{magenta}{red}{1};
       \end{tikzpicture} 

   This sequence requires only 24 color changes, with a saving of more
   than 30% of the setups.

In the examples we  always assumed  an initial state is known and that
at the end of the tour, the same state needs to be restored. In the
geographical TSP, the start city, or base station,  is known and the
tour should terminate in that node; in production or in surgery, we
assume the initial setup is given and that at the end of the day the
same setup needs to be restored. If this assumption were false,
we could easily extend the model to include any
start and end node, possibly  different one from the other.
If the initial node coincides with the final one, then clearly
choosing any different starting node, the same tour will remain
optimal.
If instead we do not know the initial and final nodes, and they are
different, we might 
insert a dummy node (a repository) connected to every other node in
the graph (in both directions)  with zero cost arcs.

This part on the TSP problem is necessarily to short, as this is one
of the most deeply explored problems in Optimization and Operations
Research. We hope we have given at least the feeling on how relevant
this problem is and of how many practical problems can be profitably
solved through a model like this one. We did not mention many other
possibilities, like, e.g., organizing the tour of an automatic
machine for the production of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated)
circuits: here the machine needs to place thousands of components on a
chip, and the TSP tour could save a significant amount of time in
moving the tool from one location to another one. A very large set of
examples, software, historical notes on the TSP problem can be found
in the :ref:`Concorde` web site.
