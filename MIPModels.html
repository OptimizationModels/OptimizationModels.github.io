<p>A <span class="target" id="index-0"></span>Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Model   (MILO or MILP) is an optimization
problem with some, possibly all, variables constrained to be
integer. Apart from this, the model is linear, with a linear objective
function and linear equalities or inequalities. Quite often all
variables are constrained to be integer, in which case the problem is
called an <span class="target" id="index-1"></span>Integer Linear optimization problem, (ILO or
ILP). The standard form of an ILO problem is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min_{\var{x}} c^T \var{x} &amp; \\
A \var{x} &amp; = b \\
\var{x} &amp; \geq 0 \\
\var{x} &amp; \in \Z^n
\end{align*}</div><p>Differently from Linear Optimization models, the feasible set
is now a discrete set, composed of a finite or at least a countable
set of feasible solutions.</p>
<p>Apparently the problem, when compared to the pure linear case, might seem
simpler to solve; in the finite case, an  explicit enumeration of all
feasible solutions might be possible and, thus,  in  finite time the
optimal feasible solution, whichever the objective, can be found.
Unfortunately the exact opposite is true: problems involving discrete
variables are, in most cases, much more difficult to solve than pure
linear optimization ones. The finiteness of the feasible set, although
a desirable property for what concerns finite convergence of an
algorithm, does not guarantee that an efficient algorithm can be
built. Indeed, frequently, an explicit  enumeration of all feasible
solutions requires a computational time which increases exponentially
with the dimension of the problem. Even when restricting to the most
basic, and also most useful, ILO problem, where all variables are
constrained to be <em>binary</em>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min_{\var{x}} c^T \var{x} &amp; \\
A \var{x} &amp; = b \\
\var{x} &amp; \geq 0 \\
\var{x} &amp; \in \{0,1\}^n
\end{align*}</div><p>an explicit enumeration would require checking feasibility of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^n\)</span> solutions, a task which becomes impossible for modern
computational hardware already for modest values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>, say
100 or more. There are many difficulties in solving these kinds of
problems, and it is not the aim of this notes to present algorithmic
approaches. However, for integer optimization models, the linkage
between the formulation, i.e., the model, and the possibility of
solving a specific instance to optimality are strongly related. The
same problems, or the same constraints, might be formulated in various
possible ways, only some of which will lead to a solution requiring a
reasonable computational effort. Thus we need to scratch at least the
surface of the computational aspects involved in the solution of
integer optimization problems.</p>
<p>Most commercial as well as open source software for the solution
of integer linear programming problems are based on an algorithmic scheme
called <span class="target" id="index-2"></span>Branch &amp; Bound, or on some variations like, e.g.,
<span class="target" id="index-3"></span>Branch &amp; Cut.</p>
<p>Given any optimization problem</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}\min_{\var{x} \in S} f(\var{x})\end{align*}</div><p>a <span class="target" id="index-4"></span>relaxation is another
optimization problem</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}\min_{\var{x} \in Q} g(\var{x})\end{align*}</div><p>which satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q \supseteq S\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x} \in S \implies g(\var{x}) \leq f(\var{x})\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two requirements have been given in order to guarantee that the
optimal value of the relaxation, if an optimum exists, is always a
lower bound of the optimal value of the original problem. Without
providing a formal proof, we can see that the first requirement asks
for a feasible set of the relaxation which contains all of the
original feasible solutions. This is one possible technique for
obtaining a lower bound, namely expanding the set of feasible
solutions. The second requirement states that for all feasible
solutions, the relaxation is not larger than the original objective
function. And this is clearly a second possibility for obtaining a
lower bound.</p>
<p>In mixed integer linear optimization, the easiest possible relaxation
is the <span class="target" id="index-5"></span>continuous relxation, which simply corresponds to
dropping the integrality constraint. Finding a good lower bound, which
in  a minimization context will mean finding one with the highest
possible optimal objective value, is a fundamental step in building
good exact optimization algorithms. By “exact” we mean algorithms
which either will stop with a certifiably optimal solution to the
problem, or they will stop with a proof of infeasibility of the
problem,
or, when stopped before natural termination, will return a
feasible solution along with an upper bound on the error with respect to
the optimum value. An exact algorithm, if stopped before termination,
might however return no feasible solution, and, in such a case, we are
left with the doubt whether the problem is infeasible or a feasible
solution might exist but was not found yet. The current optimality “gap” estimate,
which is the difference between the objective value of the best
feasible solution found so far and the current lower bound on the
optimum, depends both on the quality of feasible solutions observed as
well as on the quality of the lower bound. Thus, in order to reduce
this gap as much as possible, two strategies are needed:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>finding good feasible solutions fast. This can be done within
Branch &amp; Bound methods, but also outside them, by calling special
purpose heuristic methods</p></li>
<li><p>finding good lower bounds. This is mainly obtained through “good” relaxations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In a Branch &amp; Bound scheme, the algorithm proceeds by subdividing the
feasible set into subsets, and trying to solve subproblems within
these subsets in a recursive way. Splitting the feasible region into
subsets might have beneficial effects: sometimes the sub-problem
associated to a subset is easy to solve to optimality; sometimes it is
empty and, thus, no more subdivisions are required; sometimes
computing the lower bound in a smaller region yields an higher lower
bound and, in some cases, this  lower bound is greater then the current
upper bound (best observed feasible solution). If this is the case,
the region can be discarded from the solution process (“fathomed”) as
it cannot contain an optimal solution. This procedure is called
<span class="target" id="index-6"></span>bounding and gives the name “bound” to the algorithm</p>
<p>Having good relaxations is fundamental in bounding and in stopping. It
is important to consider that the <em>same</em> optimization problem can be
formulated in many different ways, and that the way in which a problem
is formulated might have a strong impact on the possibility to solve
it to optimality in “reasonable” computational time. To illustrate
this concept, let us take a look to a toy problem in two variables.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<p><img  src="_images/tikz-2245fb9aca75d89004b1ff0715c95c1bd5989a08.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>The feasible set is a discrete, finite, set of points denoted in the
picture by small red dots. The formulation of this feasible set might
be obtained through a set of linear inequalities, corresponding to the
blue polyhedron, with the restriction of all variables to assume
integer values only.  It is easy to see, however, that the polyhedron
indicated in this picture is not the unique possible formulation for
the same feasible set. There exist in fact different sets of
inequalities which generate a polyhedron whose integer elements are
exactly the same as those in the picture. As an example, consider the
following:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<p><img  src="_images/tikz-a067282b3f00a717b2ed56d70180606afacbabbc.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>The polyhedron represented  with dotted orange lines in the above
picture is indeed a correct formulation of the same problem. In fact
the set of feasible points with all integer coordinates is exactly the
same as before. Let us formalize this concept.</p>
<p>Given an Integer Linear Programming problem, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min c^Tx &amp;  \\
Ax &amp; = b \\
x &amp; \geq 0 \\
x &amp; \in \Z^n
\end{align*}</div><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S \subseteq \Z^n\)</span> be the feasible set. Consider another ILP
problem, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min c^Tx &amp;\\
Cx &amp; = d \\
x &amp; \geq 0 \\
x &amp; \in \Z^n
\end{align*}</div><p>We say that the formulations <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span> are
<em>equivalent</em> if and only if they represent the same set of feasible
solutions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
S &amp; = \{x \in \Z^n: Ax=b, x \geq 0\} \\
 &amp; = \{x \in \Z^n: Cx=d, x \geq 0\} \\
\end{align*}</div><p>Why we might be interested in finding more than one <em>correct</em>
formulation of the same problem? The reason is in the computational
aspects. Consider, for the problem in the above figures, an
optimization problem consisting in the minimization of, say,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-x_2\)</span>. In other words, we are looking to the feasible
solution with maximum value of the second variable, i.e., the feasible
point which lies as far as possible towards north. It is quite evident
that the optimal solution to this problem is point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((3,5)\)</span>
with an objective function value equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-5\)</span>.  If we relax
the first formulation, the optimal solution will be the top vertex in
the blue figure, with an objective value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-6\)</span>. If we perform
the same operation in the second formulation, the optimal solution of
the relaxed problem would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((3.2, 5.5)\)</span>, with an objective
function value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-5.5\)</span>, which is significantly closer to the
optimum value. We can say, in this example, that the second
formulation, although perfectly equal to the first one from the point
of view of the set of feasible solutions, is preferable from the point
of view of the quality of the relaxation. A formalization of this concept is the following:</p>
<p>Given  two correct formulation of the same mixed integer linear
optimization problem, we say that formulation  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span>  is a
<span class="target" id="index-7"></span>stronger formulation with respect to  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> if</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\{x \in \R^n: Cx=d, x \geq 0\} \subset
\{x \in \R^n: Ax=b, x \geq 0\}
\end{align*}</div><p>In other words, the second formulation is stronger (and thus better)
than the first one if its continuous relaxation generates a polyhedron
which is strictly included in the continuous relaxation of the first
one.</p>
<p>Given two formulations, it is not granted than one of the two is
stronger than the other one, as neither of the two relaxed polyhedra might be
contained in the other one. However, if this were the case, a third,
stronger, formulation can always be found by taking all of the
constraints of both the first and the second formulation. This gives
rise to a formulation whose relaxation is the intersection between the
two original ones and, thus, it is contained in both.</p>
<p>Given the above definition, we might ask ourselves whether, in the
hierarchy of possible formulations, there exist a “best” one, that is,
a formulation whose relaxation is contained in every correct
formulations of the problem. The answer is positive, at least under
quite mild assumptions like, e.g., the existence of a formulation of
the problem in which all of the coefficients are rational
numbers. This strongest formulation is called the <span class="target" id="index-8"></span>ideal
formulation. The following figure reports an example:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<p><img  src="_images/tikz-49c50e0b43a6e550f2bbbee9a1892d1e385eacdb.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>As it can be seen in the figure, but also proven in general, the ideal
formulation is characterized by the fact that its relaxation is the
<span class="target" id="index-9"></span>convex hull of the feasible set, that is, the smallest convex
set which contains all feasible solutions. The important theoretical
result is that this smallest convex set is a polyhedron, so it might
be represented as the set of solutions to a <em>finite</em> set of linear
inequalities. Another fundamental property of the ideal formulation is
the fact that every vertex, or, in the linear optimization context,
every basic feasible solution, is feasible (i.e., is integer).</p>
<p>From the point of view of our capability of solving a complex mixed
integer optimization problem it might seem that knowing the ideal
formulation would allow us to solve the problem with great efficiency,
as the simplex algorithm, or any algorithm which returns an optimal
basic solution, will immediately find the optimal <em>integer</em> solution,
without any necessity to resort to branching or bounding. We say, in
this case, that the branch and bound algorithm stops at its
root. Although knowing a good formulation and, possibly, one which is
as close as possible to the ideal one, might be very important in
practice, some important issues have to be taken into account:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in most real-life problems it is impossible to obtain the ideal
formulation</p></li>
<li><p>in some classes of widely studied problems the ideal formulation is
known, or at least a very good formulation is available. However,
very frequently, these good formulations have a huge number of
constraints, typically exponentially growing in cardinality with
the dimension of the original problem. Thus even if it remains true
that a single run of a linear optimization algorithm would return
the optimal integer solution, the huge dimension of the linear
problem makes it impossible to solve in reasonable time. And, in
some cases, it is even impossible to list all of the constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>however, it should be observed that it seems not to be necessary to
know a very good formulation of the whole problem. It seems more
important to know a formulation which is good enough <em>in the
neighborhood of the optimal solution</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last observation tells us that a good strategy to solve a complex
optimization problem might be that of starting with a good enough
formulation, solving its relaxation and, if the solution is not
feasible (integer) than a procedure might be called which generates
one, or a few, constraints to be added to the current formulation in
order to exclude the relaxed solution, without excluding any feasible
one. These constraints are called <span class="target" id="index-10"></span>cuts and they might be
obtained from an implicit representation of the ideal formulation, or,
at least, from a large set of possible inequalities.</p>
<p>These considerations might be investigated in a deeper way, but this
would lead us outside the scope of this volume. What is very relevant
and important here is to stress the fact that modeling, in the integer
optimization context, is strongly linked to the computational aspects
of the available solution algorithms. This was not the case in pure
linear optimization problems, as seen up to now. In the purely linear
case, all of the effort in modeling is in finding a correct
representation of the problem. In integer optimization, unfortunately,
this is not enough, in most cases, and a formulation needs to be found
which is not only correct, but also “strong enough”.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">16.2. </span>Modeling with integer variables<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-with-integer-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists, of course, a large class of problems in which
variables need to be integer: in a
production problem, the size of the batch to be produced is usually an
integer quantity; in
any diet problem, many of the variables associated to
the quantity of food to be  bought should  be integer, as
it is not allowed to purchase a part of box or of a can. Even in usual
cost minimization problems, the objective function can be thought of
as integer valued,  as it is unreasonable  to consider monetary values
which are not integer multiples of a given unit of
reference (for example, one Euro cent).</p>
<p>Although problems of this kind are everywhere, actually
they are not usually considered as the main body in integer optimization
and, indeed, often their resolution does not
require any special integer optimization technique. The main reason
lies in the fact that, quite often,
problems of this kind have solutions whose numerical value is,
in a certain sense, “large”: in a cost minimization problem, often the
objective is on the order of thousands or millions
of Euro. In these cases,  rounding the
solution to the nearest integer does not change much the solution and
can cause at most a tiny, negligible, violation of some constraint.
So, these problems are indeed integer optimization ones, but it is
possible to disregard integrality, solve them as continuous
optimization models, and force the obtained solution to be integer
through a simple rounding to the closest integer.
Quite different is the case
in which the components of the solution that must take on value
integers have values whose magnitude is comparable with those of the variations
introduced by  rounding: in a
diet problem, as an example, we might need to decide, for each food,
whether to buy a single portion of it or not to buy that food at all: in this case
it is impossible to establish a correct way to round
a fractional solution to either 1 or 0, unless both possibilities are
separately checked. Indeed, the decision problem itself is
equivalent to that  of choosing  whether it is more convenient to round
the solution either to 0 or to 1. So there is a large class of
difficult integer linear optimization problems characterized
by a rather limited number of alternatives for
each decision variable - at an extreme, the case of binary variables,
in which the choice is limited to two possible values only. The
apparent simplicity of this case  is contradicted by the inherent
difficulty of exploring an exponential number of possibilities: we
have in fact two possible values for a variable, 4 for two variables,
8 for three variables, …, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^n\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> binary
variables.</p>
<p>Very often the decisions to be taken are not integer valued. But
some decisions might be of a discrete nature: “either  this action or
that one has to be chosen”. Sometimes variable ranges are
discontinuous. In some other cases, logical constraints are to be
imposed: “if this happens than that should be imposed”. In these cases it is possible
to introduce additional variables into the problem that allow the
correct formulation of these decisions. Usually, these additional
variables are binary, as those variables might be associated to true/false
statements and used to formulate logical constraints, as we will see later.</p>
<section id="using-binary-variables-in-logical-constraints">
<h3><span class="section-number">16.2.1. </span>Using binary variables in logical constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#using-binary-variables-in-logical-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter we will see how
binary variables can be used as indicator functions, i.e. functions
which have value one if and only if a variable in the problem belongs
to a specific set.
These indicator whether  can be used to detect if a specific condition
occurs and then used to impose another condition to the same or to
another variable. This short presentation cannot convey the correct
information on the real opportunities available when using binary
variables, so we prefer to introduce the argument with an example.</p>
<dl class="field-list">
<dt class="field-odd">application</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><p><span class="target" id="index-11"></span>One-way choice in road  networks</p>
<p>Consider a graph in which some arcs are not (yet) oriented.
On each arch a maximum capacity is assigned. The
problem we would like to model in this example is the
decision on the orientation of these arcs.As an example,
in a road network we would like to choose the directions for a few
one-way arcs,  in such a way that a measure of the maximum flow is
optimized. In particular, consider the case of a maximum flow
network between a source and a destination node, and we have the
possibility of deciding the orientation of a few arcs so as to
maximize the flow. A more realistic application might consider two
different flows, corresponding to morning and afternoon peak
hours. During morning peak a source node generates flow towards the
destination, while during the afternoon peak all the flow at the
destination node has to be routed back to the origin.  The decision
problem on how to make the network directed is a relevant network
design problem.</p>
<p>Here we will see how it is possible to use binary variables to model
the binary decision on the allowed direction of flow for a specific
edge  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{i,j\}\)</span> which we would like to transform into an
oriented arc, either   <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((i,j)\)</span> or   <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((j,i)\)</span>.
We introduce two binary variables associated to each of the two
possible arcs: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_{ji}\)</span>;
to each of these variables we would like to associate  the allowed
direction of travel:
if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1\)</span>
the arc is oriented so that the flow is allowed  in the direction
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i \rightarrow j\)</span>.
When formulating the model we should take into account that we need to
link variables by means of equations or inequalities, while “propositional
connectives”, like NOT (negation), IF, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR,  are
not allowed.</p>
<p>Saying that an arc has a specific orientation, means that along that
arc a flow is allowed, whose value is between zero and the capacity of
the arc.
On the contrary, if the flow is not possible along that arc, both the
lower as well as the upper bound on the flow will be zero.
Denoting by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{CapMax}_{ij}\)</span> the maximum arc capacity, the following
set of feasible solutions needs to be considered:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1,&amp;  0 \leq \var{f}_{ij} \leq \param{CapMax}_{ij} \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 0,&amp;  0 \leq \var{f}_{ij} \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>The last double inequality simply states that the
flow must be zero.
Thanks to the fact that the logical variable is binary, we can use
it to “switch” the capacity on or off: this is easily obtained
multyplying the arc capacity by the binary variable.
Thus the set of feasible solutions given above, which is indeed
associated to  a logical constraint, can
be formulated  through a linear inequality:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
0 \leq \var{f}_{ij} \leq \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \param{CapMax}_{ij}
\end{align*}</div><p>This is a fundamental constraint in which a  link is defined
between a binary decision  variable and a continuous flow
variable.
A similar model should be imposed to the flow on the opposite direction:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
0 \leq \var{f}_{ji} \leq \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} \param{CapMax}_{ij}
\end{align*}</div><p>In the problem analyzed here, a constraint should also be imposed to force
one, and only one, direction to be chosen.
In practice, it is sufficient to impose the decision
on one of the two directions is opposite to the decision on  the
other one. That is, if we decide to allow a flow along one of the
two directions, flow must be prohibited along the other one. In formula:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{ji} = 1 - \mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
\end{align*}</div><p>or, equivalently,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>The first equality reminds us that the  value of one of the
two logical variables is the logical negation of the other one (one
is true, i.e., equal to 1, if and only if the other one is false,
or 0). That equation shows how to define a logical variable as the
negation of another one. The second, equivalent, equation can also
be interpreted as an exclusive or (XOR) statement: it forces exactly
one out of the two variables to be true (one), while the other one
is forced to zero. This might be extended to a generalized XOR
statement involving several variables.</p>
<p>The complete  model is thus:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
0 \leq \var{f}_{ij} &amp; \leq \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \param{CapMax}_{ij} \\
0 \leq \var{f}_{ji} &amp; \leq \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} \param{CapMax}_{ij} \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} &amp; = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>Of course, in this problem it is also possible to eliminate one of
the two binary variables, solving the corresponding XOR equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
   \begin{align*}
   0 \leq \var{f}_{ij} &amp; \leq \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \param{CapMax}_{ij} \\
   0 \leq \var{f}_{ji} &amp; \leq (1- \mathvar{\delta}_{ij})
   \param{CapMax}_{ij}.
   \end{align*}</div></dd>
</dl>
<p>This application has been presented in order to show
an elementary link between an indicator variable and a continuous
one.
In the example above, it was shown that, through a
binary  variable, two different situations can be modeled (flow / no
flow).</p>
<p>A very useful tool to link
binary decision variables  to other variables is the following
constraint:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} \leq A \mathvar{\delta} + B (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>or the analogue one with in the opposite direction:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} \geq A \mathvar{\delta} + B (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>Here  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}\)</span> represents a
variable or an expression, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> is a
binary indicator variable (we will when possible use
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> to denote binary variables in such a way
that they can be immediately recognized), <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>
and  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>  are suitable constant.
Let us consider the first inequality in more detail.
Considering the  two possible values for the binary variable,
the set of feasible solutions turns
out to be:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\{\mathvar{\delta} = 1,  \var{x} \leq A \} &amp; \bigcup
\{\mathvar{\delta} = 0,  \var{x} \leq B   \}
\end{align*}</div><p>If we   assume, e.g.,
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A &lt;B\)</span>,   then in both cases <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x} \leq B\)</span>
will be true.   However, in one case a more stringent upper bound will
be obtained:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; \leq B \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x} \leq A
\end{align*}</div><p>The first is a “trivial” constraint, which is always satisfied whatever the
value of the logical variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span>; the second
one is a logical constraint.</p>
<p>If, on the opposite,  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B &lt;A\)</span>, the
same constraint would represent:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; \leq A \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x} \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>In the example of the one-way arc problem,
this constraint was used with the choice <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A =
\param{CapMax}_{ij}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B = 0\)</span>.
In fact, this corresponds  to imposing the logical constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{f}_{ij} &amp; \leq \param{CapMax}_{ij} \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &amp;= 0 \implies \var{f}_{ij} \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>It might be worth to observe that the above implication
only requires that the flow is zero in the event that the
binary variable is zero. In the opposite case, it is not necessarily
true that the flow is non zero.</p>
<p>In general, the constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} \leq A \mathvar{\delta} + B (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>can be interpreted as follows: if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A &lt; B\)</span> the constraint
represents the logical implication</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp;\implies \var{x} \leq A \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>or, equivalently from a logical point of view,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}&gt; A &amp;\implies \mathvar{\delta} = 0 \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>If  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A&gt; B\)</span>
then the logical  constraint  would correspond to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} &amp; = 0 \implies \var{x} \leq B \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq A
\end{align*}</div><p>or, equivalently,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; &gt; B \implies \mathvar{\delta} = 1 \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq A
\end{align*}</div><p>It seems to be a good idea, at this point, to recall some basic facts
of first order propositional logic. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\implies\)</span>
connective can be
written in an equivalent way
using the “OR” (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lor\)</span>)  and the “NOT” (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot\)</span> )
connectives.</p>
<p>In particular, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A \implies B\)</span> is logically equivalent
to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot A \lor B\)</span>. Writing the truth table of the implication
we get:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\begin{array} [c] {|c|c|c|}
A &amp; B &amp; A \implies B \\ \hline
T &amp; T &amp; T \\
T &amp; F &amp; F \\
F &amp; T &amp; T \\
F &amp; F &amp; T \\ \hline
\end{array}
\end{align*}</div><p>We can therefore see that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A \implies B\)</span> corresponds to the following
events: if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> must be true,
while if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is
false, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> can be either true or false. Or, put in a
different but equivalent way, the implication only excludes the
possibility that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is false, all
other possible combinations being acceptable.</p>
<p>It is also easy to
see that the statement</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
A \implies B
\end{align*}</div><p>is logically equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\lnot B \implies \lnot A;
\end{align*}</div><p>and both are equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\lnot A \lor B
\end{align*}</div><p>To prove
this statement it is sufficient to build the truth tables of
both logical expressions.</p>
<p>Binary indicator variables are often used in a model
to add logical constraints  linking continuous variables together.
As an example, in a diet problem, consider the case in which
the following constraint is required: “if food A is in the diet,
then food B should be absent”. As an example, A might be fish while B
is red wine. Denoting by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_{B}\)</span> the variables
corresponding to the two food types,
we would like to add the constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_{A}&gt; 0 \implies \var{x}_{B} = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>One possibility to formulate this logical constraint consists in
inserting, within the implication, a binary variable to indicate
whether or not the event occurs:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_{A}&gt; 0 \implies \mathvar{\delta} = 1 \implies \var{x}_{B} = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>In this case we can split the problem and formulate the two
implications:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_{A}&gt; 0 &amp; \implies &amp; \mathvar{\delta} = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies &amp; \var{x}_{B} = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Let us start with the first one, which can be written in an equivalent
way with the logical variable on the left hand side of the implication:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 0 \implies \var{x}_{A} \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Recall that logical constraints are used to impose inequalities; but
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_A = 0\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_A = 0\)</span>, as
non negativity constraints are imposed on all variables in a
diet problem.</p>
<p>The logical constraint as it has just been formulated associates a
specific upper bound to the continuous variable. In order to
be able to correctly formulate a constraint representing this logic, a
“trivial” upper bound, which is always valid, should be considered.
Assume that an upper limit is known for the quantity of food A in the
diet (e.g., one portion at most); we denote by  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{Qmax}_A\)</span>
this bound. Now the formulation can be obtained from:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_A \leq 0 \\
\var{x}_A &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_A
\end{align*}</div><p>and  the following constraints are then obtained:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_A \mathvar{\delta} + 0 (1-
\mathvar{\delta}) &amp; \textrm{or, equivalently,} \\
\var{x}_A &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_A \mathvar{\delta}
\end{align*}</div><p>It is immediate to verify that if  variable
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_A\)</span> takes non-zero (strictly positive) value, then
the  logical variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> will be forced to take the value 1.
In a similar way we can proceed for the second part
of the implication. As in the case
just analyzed, we need to formulate an implication that matches the desired constraint
in case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta} = 1\)</span> and a trivial, always true,
constraint to apply in  the
default case. The logical constraint we would like to formulate is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \implies \var{x}_B = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Assuming that   in a diet problems all variables are constrained to be
non-negative variables, the constraint
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_B = 0\)</span>  can be equivalently expressed
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_B \leq 0\)</span>. Notice that this transformation of an
equation into an inequality is necessary when, as here, the equation
appears on the right hand side of the implication connective.</p>
<p>The logical constraint to be formulated is  therefore:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \implies \var{x}_B \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>In the alternative case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta} = 0\)</span>, the
constraint must turn out to be a  trivial one. If, as
in the  case of food type A, also for food type B, an
upper limit <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{Qmax}_B\)</span> is given, then the formulation becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_B \leq \param{Qmax}_B (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>and therefore  the whole model sought has the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_{A} &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_A \mathvar{\delta} \\
\var{x}_{B} &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_B (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>The transformation just introduced is just one of the many
possibilities to transform a logical statement into a set of linear
equations and inequalities. Many other modeling of the same constraint
are indeed possible.
A different possibility for the example analyzed here
consists in re-writing the original logical constraint in a
<span class="target" id="index-12"></span>disjunctive form, i.e., as a set of statements connected one
to the other through an “OR” logical connective.
Recalling the definition of the logical implication,
the constraint analyzed in this part might also  be expressed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A \leq 0 \lor \var{x}_B \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>To translate this constraint into linear inequalities an idea might be
that of associating a
binary variable  to each one of  the two events
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_A \leq 0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_B \leq 0\)</span>. Let
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_B\)</span>
denote these logical variables. Assume we have already introduced
suitable constraints so that if any of these binary variables has vale
1 (true)  then the event we would like to model is true.
Once this has been done (and we will see how to formulate this link),
the constraint to be imposed to model the “OR” connective  is
rather simple; in fact the logical  “OR” only excludes the case
in which  both variables are zero. Thus the logical
constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 \lor \mathvar{\delta}_B = 1\)</span>
can be translated into the lineare constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B &amp; \geq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>This constraint allows any combination of the values of the two
binary variables except
the case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_A=\mathvar{\delta}_B=0\)</span>.
This constraint, therefore, correctly represents the logical “OR”
constraint. It is now  necessary to link the logical variables to the
events we wish to keep under control. The above logical constraint
forces at least one of the two binary variables to be equal to 1.
We would like now to add a constraint which, when a binary variable is
1 (“true”), forces the event we are interested in (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_A
\leq 0\)</span>) to be true.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x}_A \leq 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_B = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x}_B \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>The two constraints are formally identical, so we concentrate on the
first one. Recall that, besides what is written above, we should take
into account that, when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_A = 0\)</span>, the
constraint should become a  trivial one. We obtain thus the following
formulation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A \leq 0 \mathvar{\delta}_A + \param{Qmax}_A (1- \mathvar{\delta}_A)
\end{align*}</div><p>and, similarly, for the second linking constraint:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_B \leq 0 \mathvar{\delta}_B + \param{Qmax}_B (1- \mathvar{\delta}_B)
\end{align*}</div><p>In summary, the complete model can be formulated as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_A (1- \mathvar{\delta}_A) \\
\var{x}_B &amp; \leq \param{Qmax}_B (1- \mathvar{\delta}_B) \\
\mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B &amp; \geq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>It is important to observe that
we did not formulate a
double logical implication:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A &gt;0 &amp;\iff \var{x}_B = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>(we choose fish if and only if there is no red wine in the diet).
In order to formulate this double implication,  we need to add the
following constraint to the model:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_B = 0 \implies \var{x}_A&gt; 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Following the first  modeling example we obtain:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_B = 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta} = 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_A&gt; 0
\end{align*}</div><p>while, with   the second  logical constraint formulation, we have:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A&gt; 0 \lor \var{x}_B&gt; 0
\end{align*}</div><p>and the constraints to be formulates are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_A&gt; 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_B = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_B&gt; 0
\end{align*}</div><p>In addition to these constraints, we should require that one of the
two variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> to be zero:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
(1- \mathvar{\delta}_A) + (1- \mathvar{\delta}_B) &amp; \geq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B &amp; \leq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>but, taking into account also the previously imposed “OR” constraint,
it is easy to see that we are indeed interested in an “XOR” (exclusive
OR) connective:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B &amp; = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>Whichever the way the connection between logical variables and
continuous one is formulated,
we are eventually required to formulate an implication of the
following type:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x}&gt; 0.
\end{align*}</div><p>(or an analogous one with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta} = 0\)</span> on the left
hand side).
A constraint of this type <em>cannot</em> be represented
by means of linear constraints with continuous and binary variables.
Indeed, it can actually be proved
<span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="Bibliography.html#id18"><span>14</span></a>]</span> that a transformation of this logical implication
to linear constraints is indeed impossible.</p>
<p>A possible partial solution would be
to strengthen  the constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}&gt; 0\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}
\geq \varepsilon&gt; 0\)</span>; this choice would exclude some
solutions from the feasible set. In many cases, even if not always,
this is acceptable. For example, in the case of a diet, we
might require that if we decide to buy a specific food type,
we must purchase at least a certain minimum quantity, for example
a single portion. In this case, setting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon = 1.0\)</span>, we
would get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_{A} &amp; \geq \mathvar{\delta} \\
\var{x}_{B} &amp; \geq (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>We can see that, by combining these constraints with the previous ones, if
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta} = 1\)</span> we would be forced to buy at least
one portion  of food A and no food B, while in the opposite case
food B would be present with at least 1 units while food A would be absent.</p>
<p>It can also be noticed that, in this case, it is also possible
obtain the same effect of these last constraints without resorting to
logical variables:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A + \var{x}_B &amp; \geq \varepsilon
\end{align*}</div><p>In fact, the first group of  constraints  introduced guarantee that,
if  food A is in the diet, then food B would not be included. In this
case, food A would be in the diet with at least <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span>
portions.  Otherwise, if food A is not in the diet, then this constraint
would require the presence of at least <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span>  portions
of food B, as requested.</p>
<p>Another simple example might arise in production planning
models. Assume we would like to add a constraint which imposes that,
once the inventory reaches a level zero, it will remain zero until the
end of the planning period. This might be a decision to close an
inventory:  we keep the inventory until it is needed, but from a
period on it will remain closed. The closing period is not fixed a
priori, but it is left to the optimization model to decide when it
will be  convenient to switch it off. If, as we have seen in the
chapter of multiperiod linear models, a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{s}_t\)</span>
represents the inventory level at the beginning of period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>,
the logical constraint to be included is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_t = 0 \implies \var{s}_{t+1} = 0 \quad \forall\,t \in
\{1,2,\ldots, T-1\}
\end{align*}</div><p>We may add a binary variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_t\)</span> and
reformulate the constraints as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_t = 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_t = 1 \\
 \mathvar{\delta}_t = 1  &amp; \implies \var{s}_{t+1} = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>and these  can be put in a linear form as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_t  &amp; \geq \varepsilon (1-\mathvar{\delta}_t) \\
\var{s}_{t+1} &amp; \leq M_t \mathvar{\delta}_t
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is a small threshold corresponding to a
minimum non zero inventory level and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_t\)</span> is an upper bound
on the inventory level at each time period.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">16.2.2. </span>How to use binary variables to impose constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-binary-variables-to-impose-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is possible, in quite a simple way, to use binary variables
to impose  a generic linear constraint.
Actually, for inequality constraints, it is sufficient to
use the techniques just presented and applying it to the slack or surplus variable of
the constraint. For example, in order to formulate the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \implies \sum_j a_j \var{x}_j \leq b
\end{align*}</div><p>we can simply  introduce the slack variable</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
 \begin{align*}
 \var{s} = b- \sum_j a_j \var{x}_j
 \end{align*}</div><p>and formulate the constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \implies \var{s} \geq0
\end{align*}</div><p>and get to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s} \geq 0 \mathvar{\delta} + L (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L &lt;0\)</span> is a trivial lower bound
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{s}\)</span>, or, equivalently, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b- \sum_j a_j
\var{x}_j\)</span>. Re-writing the constraint without introducing the slack
variable, we get:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\sum_j a_j \var{x}_j \leq L (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>To obtain a good  estimate of the lower bound <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> in cases
in which it  is not evident from the
context, a linear optimization  problem could be solved with the objective of
minimizing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b - \sum_j a_j \var{x}_j\)</span> within the constraints
of the model.</p>
<p>Similarly, we might also proceed by considering the left hand side
of the inequality as a variable, and deduce
the model</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
a^T\var{x} \leq b \mathvar{\delta} + M (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> is an  upper bound of the left hand side <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_j a_j
\var{x}_j\)</span> in the feasible set.</p>
<p>As an example, in a diet problem assume that  we wish to impose

<dd class="field-odd"><p><span class="target" id="index-13"></span>Project Planning with incompatible resources</p>
<p>Consider a project planning problem with
some  precedence constraints, similar to the model discussed
previously, as an application of the dual of the longest path
problem (see the <a class="reference internal" href="ShortestPath.html#cpm"><span class="std std-ref">Project Planning</span></a> model).</p>
<p>In this kind of models there are pairs of activities for which
a temporal precedence constraint needs to be imposed
(for example, the roof cannot be built
before finishing the main columns).</p>
<p>In some situations, however, there exist pairs of <em>incompatible</em> activities,
that is, activities whose scheduling should be done in such a way
that they do not overlap in time.
This may happen when both activities require the exclusive use of
the same resource. In a recipe planning example,  there exists
no logical precedence between the operation of  boiling
water and the activity of sauce preparation; they might be planned
in quite an independent way, starting any of them without too much
consideration of the starting time of the other one. However, when both
require a scarce resources, a precedence might be needed. Think, as
an example, to the situation in which a single fire is available.
In this case a precedence should be imposed
between  these two activities, as either boiling is started and
finished before the beginning of sauce preparation, or on the
opposite, sauce preparation should be scheduled to finish before
starting boiling the water.
So, there must be a sequence between the two operations, but this
sequence in not imposed “from the outside”, but is part of the
decision process: which precedence is more convenient, from the
objective function point of view?</p>
<p>In a case like this one, in which  the incompatibility is limited to
a pair of activities, it  would be trivial to solve a
number of planning problems, trying all
possible precedences. In this case we might solve a CPM problem
with activity sauce preparation after activity boil water, and
another one with activity boil water after activity prepare the
sauce. At the end, we might compare the total project durations in
the two cases and choose the shortest one.</p>
<p>However it is easily understood that, as the number of incompatible pairs
grows, the number of cases to check grows exponentially
and, therefore, an explicit enumeration is out of question.</p>
<p>We can however use logical variables to formulate these
incompatibility constraints.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> be the indices of two
incompatible activities whose start times are represented by
variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{t}_i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{t}_j\)</span>
respectively.
Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{d}_i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{d}_j\)</span> the
durations of these activities. To formulate the incompatibility
we need  to impose the logical constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{t}_i &amp; \geq \var{t}_j + \param{d}_j \qquad  \lor \\
\var{t}_j &amp; \geq \var{t}_i + \param{d}_i
\end{align*}</div><p>In order to formulate  these constraint we might, as usual,
follow different paths. For example,  associating a binary variable
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}\)</span> to the event <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> precedes
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>,  we would get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1
&amp; \implies \var{t}_j - \var{t}_i \geq
\param{d}_i \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ji} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{t}_i - \var{t}_j \geq
\param{d}_j \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} &amp; = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>Let  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{T}_{\min}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{T}_{\max}\)</span> denote
the earliest starting time of the project and an
upper limit on its completion.  We obtain:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{t}_j - \var{t}_i &amp; \geq \param{d}_i
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + (\param{T}_{\min} - \param{T}_{\max})
(1- \mathvar{\delta}_{ij}) \\
\var{t}_i - \var{t}_j &amp; \geq \param{d}_j
\mathvar{\delta}_{ji} + (\param{T}_{\min} - \param{T}_{\max})
(1- \mathvar{\delta}_{ji}) \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + \mathvar{\delta}_{ji} &amp; = 1

easily eliminated:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{t}_j - \var{t}_i &amp; \geq \param{d}_i
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} + (\param{T}_{\min} - \param{T}_{\max})

\var{t}_i - \var{t}_j &amp; \geq \param{d}_j
(1-\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}) + (\param{T}_{\min} - \param{T}_{\max})
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
\end{align*}</div><p>The same situation can also be modeled by observing that the
incompatibility constraints can also be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{t}_i  &lt; \var{t}_j + \param{d}_j  \implies
\var{t}_j  \geq \var{t}_i + \param{d}_i
\end{align*}</div><p>which corresponds to requiring that if an activity starts before
the other one is finished, it should start “early enough”.
In this case, introducing a binary  variable, we might split the
implication into:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{t}_i  &lt; \var{t}_j + \param{d}_j &amp; \implies
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1\\
\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 &amp; \implies
\var{t}_j  \geq \var{t}_i + \param{d}_i

<h3><span class="section-number">16.2.3. </span>Propositional logic and binary variables<a class="headerlink" href="#propositional-logic-and-binary-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although we do not wish to go too deeply in  mathematical logics,
it seems worthwhile to add some considerations on the
relationship between logical propositions and linear constraints with
binary variables.</p>
<p>We have just seen how a binary variable can be used to impose logical
constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies  \var{x} \leq A \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>which translates as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} \leq A \mathvar{\delta} + B (1- \mathvar{\delta}).
\end{align*}</div><p>if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A &lt;B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Most of the modeling techniques seen so far were related to logical
implications (“if … then”). We have shown how to transform a constraint like,
e.g.,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}&gt; A \implies \var{y} \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>through the introduction of a logical variable and logical constraints</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}&gt; A &amp; \implies  \mathvar{\delta} = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies  \var{y} \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>These are  equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} = 0 &amp; \implies  \var{x} \leq A \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies  \var{y} \leq B
\end{align*}</div><p>from which the following  formulation is obtained:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; \leq  M_1 \mathvar{\delta} + A (1- \mathvar{\delta}) \\
\var{y} &amp; \leq  B \mathvar{\delta} + M_2 (1- \mathvar{\delta})
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_2\)</span> are suitable constants.
It was also seen that
it is possible to obtain an alternative formulation
by associating a binary variable with each event in the implication.</p>
<p>In this paragraph we will see  in more details how it might be
possible to derive some general rules for the formulation of
logical links.</p>
<p>Propositional logic allows the formulation  of logical expressions
containing several connectives like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lor\)</span>: logical OR, or union</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\land\)</span>: logical AND, or intersection</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot\)</span>: logical NOT, or negation</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\implies\)</span>: logical implication</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\iff\)</span>: double implication</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to correctly formulate logical constraints between
variables or constraints of a generic
optimization model,
binary indicator variables are usually associated to “events”.
For example, consider a blending problem in which we would like to add
the following constraint: “if in the
blend  material A is present (non zero), then either material  B  or
material C must not be included”.
A first step in
modeling such a rule might be to connect the
events (is A non zero in the blend? is B non zero?) to logical,
binary, variables.
Then, we can impose the logical condition by adding constraints
involving just the logical variables.
As an example, assume  we associated three binary variables to the
three events
in such a way that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*} \mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 \iff \var{x}_A &gt; 0 \end{align*}</div><p>(where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_j\)</span> represents the quantity of material
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> in the blend) and similarly for the other two materials. Then  the logical constraint
becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 \implies \mathvar{\delta}_B = 0 \lor \mathvar{\delta}_C = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Actually, there is no need to link  the events to binary double
through a double implication. In this example it is quite easy to see that it would be enough
to impose</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A&gt; 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_B = 0 \lor \mathvar{\delta}_C = 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_B = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_B = 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_C = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_C = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>We have already seen how to connect a logical variable to a continuous
one. Let us now consider the logical constraint itself, i.e., the
constraint involving only logic variables:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A
\implies (\lnot \mathvar{\delta}_B \lor \lnot \mathvar{\delta}_C)
\end{align*}</div><p>In order to formulate a “disjunction” (i.e. the union or logical “OR”) between
two  events <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X,Y\)</span>  to which two binary variables are
associated, it will be sufficient to impose that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{X} + \mathvar{\delta}_{Y} \geq1
\end{align*}</div><p>along with the linking constraints</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{X} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x} \in X \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{Y} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x} \in Y
\end{align*}</div><p>Let us analyze more closely how to model some of the most common
logical connectives through linear constraints in binary (logical)
variables.</p>
<p>The negation of a logical variable is simply given by the complement
of that variable: variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - \mathvar{\delta}_X\)</span> assumes
value  1  (true) if and only if  variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_X\)</span>
takes value 0 (false).</p>
<p>For what concerns the logical implication, recalling its formulation
in terms of disjunction and negation,  we  derive:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_X = 1 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 1 \\
\lnot \{\mathvar{\delta}_X = 1 \} &amp; \lor \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_X = 0 &amp; \lor \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 1 \\
(1- \mathvar{\delta}_X) + \mathvar{\delta}_Y &amp; \geq 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_X &amp; \leq \mathvar{\delta}_Y
\end{align*}</div><p>The logical “AND” connective, in some cases,  does not create
modeling problems, as any system (of equations or
inequalities) already represents a set of  constraints which are  linked to each other
with an “AND”  connective. Within
a logical constraint, inserting a term  representing an “AND”
logical, apparently can be done in an easy way writing the expression</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_X \mathvar{\delta}_Y
\end{align*}</div><p>which is equal to 1 if  and only if both variables
are equal to 1. However this expression is not a linear one, and, from
an integer optimization point of view, non linarities are to be
avoided, if at all possible. Indeed,
all logical constraints of propositional logic, built with the
connectives listed before, can be
represented by means of linear constraints. If we wish to define a
logical variable whose value is equivalent to that
of the “AND”, then a new binary variable
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span>  might  be introduced along with the
constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_X = 1, \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 1 &amp; \implies
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_X = 1, \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>The first constraint is equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_X = 0 \lor \mathvar{\delta}_Y = 0 \lor

\begin{align*}
(1- \mathvar{\delta}_X) + (1- \mathvar{\delta}_Y) +
\mathvar{\delta} &amp; \geq 1

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_X + \mathvar{\delta}_Y -
\mathvar{\delta} &amp; \leq 1;

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>The transformation we have seen so far seems to be quite ad-hoc,
as there is no general strategy nor a clear way to automate the
translation process from a logical formula to a set of linear
inequalities. It must be recalled that, as it was already pointed out,
that in integer optimization a correct formulation is usually not
enough: what we need is more a correct and strong formulation. So,
until a general theory of strong formulations for logical constraints
will be developed, it is necessary to try different formulation and to
compare them.</p>
<p>However there are a few standard ways to generate
constraints which represent any given propositional formula.</p>
<p>A logical expression is called a  <span class="target" id="index-14"></span>clause if it can be
expressed in the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
E_1 \lor E_2 \lor \ldots E_k \lor \lnot E_{k + 1} \lor \lnot E_{k + 2} \lor
\ldots \lor \lnot E_{h}
\end{align*}</div><p>where each expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_i\)</span>, called <span class="target" id="index-15"></span>literal, can  either be true or false.
The above clause  contains <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>
literals,  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h-k\)</span>   of which in a negated form. In order to
transform this clause into a set of linear constraints,
first a logical variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_i\)</span> is associated
to each literal and then a single linear constraint can be easily formed:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 1}^k \mathvar{\delta}_i + \sum_{i=k + 1}^h (1 - \mathvar{\delta}_i) \geq   1
\end{align*}</div><p>In order to link variables to literals in the above constraint,
observe that the inequality is verified if at least one of the
variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_i\)</span> associated with affirmed literals is
equal to  1  or if at least one of the variables associated with
negated literals is 0. Thus it is enough to  to impose the following
logical constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_i = 1  &amp; \implies E_i
&amp; \forall \, i = 1, \ldots, k \\
\mathvar{\delta}_i = 0 &amp; \implies \lnot E_i
&amp; \forall \, i = k + 1, \ldots h
\end{align*}</div><p>The last set of implications is  equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
E_i \implies \mathvar{\delta}_i = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>For example, if we would like  to model the constraint  A  is included
in a blend or  B  is absent or  C  is absent, we might write
a logical constraint of the type</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A + (1- \mathvar{\delta}_B) + (1- \mathvar{\delta}_C) \geq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_B + \mathvar{\delta}_C \leq \mathvar{\delta}_A + 1
\end{align*}</div><p>and the links between binary and continuous variables will be of the
type</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_A = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x}_A \geq \epsilon \\
\mathvar{\delta}_B = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_B \leq 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_C = 0 &amp; \implies \var{x}_C \leq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>and if all variables are non negative and upper bounded by a constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>
this translates into</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A &amp; \geq &amp; \epsilon \mathvar{\delta}_A \\
\var{x}_B &amp; \leq &amp; M \mathvar{\delta}_B \\
\var{x}_C &amp; \leq &amp; M \mathvar{\delta}_C \\
\end{align*}</div><p>It can be shown that every logic formula built with a finite number of
symbols and the connectives listed before, i.e.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\land, \lor, \lnot, \implies, \iff\)</span>, can always be written in an
equivalent form, called <span class="target" id="index-16"></span>normal conjunctiva form  which is the
conjunction (i.e., the intersection) of a finite number of
clauses. It is also always  possible to write  a
logical formula in a <span class="target" id="index-17"></span>disjunctive normal form, that is, as a union
of statements,  each of which is the intersection
(AND) of literals. A  possible way  to obtain these normal forms is to
apply some logical transformation rules recursively:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\neg (A \lor B) &amp; \equiv  \neg A \land \neg B \\
\neg (A \land B) &amp; \equiv  \neg A \lor \neg B \\
A \lor (B \land C) &amp; \equiv  (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C) \\
A \land (B \lor C) &amp; \equiv  (A \land B) \lor (A \land C).
\end{align*}</div><p>Through the application of the above  rules it is always possible to switch from any
proposition to any of the two normal forms. However,  it can be also shown that,
in the worst case, a transformation algorithm based on these
rules requires both an exponential time as well as an exponential
memory  as a function of the number  of literals. It is outside the
scope of this volume, however, it is worth recalling that
an efficient algorithm exists  for the  translation  of any logical
formula in normal form
(see <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="Bibliography.html#id19"><span>8</span></a>]</span>); this algorithm requires the  addition of  new literals, but
it requires a time and a memory occupation which grows only
linearly with the dimension of the proposition.</p>
<p>While, from a logical point of view, many equivalent formulations of the same
proposition can be  found, like, e.g., the two normal forms, from the
numerical point of view there might be important differences, in terms
of the strength of the resulting linear optimization models.
To introduce these ideas an  example may be useful.</p>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_A&gt; 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_{A} = 1 \\
\var{x}_B&gt; 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_{B} = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{C} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x}_C&gt; 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{D} = 0 &amp;\implies \var{x}_D = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>These latter constraints can be modeled as it was already shown in
previous paragraphs. Let’s focus on the logical constraint.</p>
<p>We might  formulate  the implication in a direct way, introducing a new
indicator variable:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
(\mathvar{\delta}_{A} + \mathvar{\delta}_{B} \geq1) &amp; \implies
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies
(\mathvar{\delta}_{C} - \mathvar{\delta}_{D} \geq0)
\end{align*}</div><p>which becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{A} + \mathvar{\delta}_{B} \leq2 \mathvar{\delta} \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{C} - \mathvar{\delta}_{D} \geq \mathvar{\delta} -1
\end{align*}</div><p>Alternatively the initial implication could be transformed
in the  following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\lnot (A \lor B) \lor C \lor \lnot D
\end{align*}</div><p>which,  exploiting the distributive property, is transformed
as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
(\lnot A \land \lnot B) \lor (C \lor \lnot D) \equiv \\
(\lnot A \lor C \lor \lnot D) \land (\lnot B \lor C \lor \lnot D)
\end{align*}</div><p>This one is  a <em>normal conjunctiv form</em>, which
can immediately be written as a  linear set of constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
1- \mathvar{\delta}_{A} + \mathvar{\delta}_{C} + 1-
\mathvar{\delta}_{D} &amp; \geq1 \\
1- \mathvar{\delta}_{B} + \mathvar{\delta}_{C} + 1-
\mathvar{\delta}_{D} &amp; \geq1
\end{align*}</div><p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{A} - \mathvar{\delta}_{C} +
\mathvar{\delta}_{D} &amp; \leq 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{B} - \mathvar{\delta}_{C} +
\mathvar{\delta}_{D}  &amp; \leq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>To compare these two formulations, recall that the comparison needs
to be based on the linear relaxation of the integer constraints.
In this example it seems not easy
to compare the two formulations, as  the first one has a variable
which is not included in the second one.
However, it can be seen that
the dependency on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> in the first model can be
eliminated.
Rewriting the first formulation as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
0.5(\mathvar{\delta}_{A} + \mathvar{\delta}_{B} ) &amp;\leq \mathvar{\delta} \\
\mathvar{\delta}&amp; \leq 1     +  \mathvar{\delta}_{C} - \mathvar{\delta}_{D}
\end{align*}</div><p>the variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> can be eliminated and the
formulation becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{A} + \mathvar{\delta}_{B} &amp; \leq 2(\mathvar{\delta}_{C} - \mathvar{\delta}_{D} +1)
\end{align*}</div><p>Let us denote by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> the polyhedron obtained relaxing all
variables in the above formulation to belong to the interval
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0,1]\)</span>. Let us also denote by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span> the relaxed
polyhedron associated to the  normal conjunctive form seen before.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2 \subset P_1\)</span>. In fact, from one
side, adding the constraints</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{A} - \mathvar{\delta}_{C} +
\mathvar{\delta}_{D} &amp; \leq 1 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_{B} - \mathvar{\delta}_{C} +
\mathvar{\delta}_{D}  &amp; \leq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>we obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{A} +
\mathvar{\delta}_{B} - 2\mathvar{\delta}_{C} +
2 \mathvar{\delta}_{D}  &amp; \leq 2
\end{align*}</div><p>which is exactly the formulation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span>. Moreover,
assigning to the indicator variables (in the relaxed polyhedra)
the values  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,0,0,1/2\)</span> respectively, the resulting solution
satisfies all of the constraint in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> but not the
corresponding ones in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span>
Thus, in this example, the conjunctiva is stronger than the direct one.</p>
<p>The same problem can also be brought into a disjunctive normal form:
using again the distributive properties of AND and OR, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
(\lnot A \land \lnot B) \lor C \lor \lnot D
\end{align*}</div><p>which is a union (or disjunction) of literals connected to each other by
AND (conjunction). This statement can also be translated into
linear constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} + \mathvar{\delta}_C + (1- \mathvar{\delta}_D) &amp; \geq  1 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies  \mathvar{\delta}_A = 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies  \mathvar{\delta}_B = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>which becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta} + \mathvar{\delta}_C &amp; \geq  \mathvar{\delta}_D \\
\mathvar{\delta}_A &amp; \leq  1 - \mathvar{\delta} \\
\mathvar{\delta}_B &amp; \leq  1 - \mathvar{\delta}
\end{align*}</div><p>In order to compare this formulation with the
normal conjunctive one,  observe that the
disjunctive formulation is equivalent to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_D - \mathvar{\delta}_C \leq &amp; \mathvar{\delta}  \leq 1 - \mathvar{\delta}_A \\
\mathvar{\delta}_D - \mathvar{\delta}_C \leq &amp; \mathvar{\delta}  \leq 1 - \mathvar{\delta}_B
\end{align*}</div><p>and that, therefore, in the  original variable space,
the two formulations are equivalent.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This example should not be generalized: often the
disjunctive formulation leads to stronger formulations  than that
conjunctive one. Interesting research on the strength of these
formulation was performed in <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="Bibliography.html#id18"><span>14</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>As a final remark, we would like to add that the automatic
reformulation of logical constraints in strong linear formulation is a
field of active research, and these notes were just meant to give an
introduction to the subject. I tmight be interesting to observe also
that there are classes of logical constraints which generate ideal
polyhedra. The best known of these is the set of <span class="target" id="index-19"></span>Horn
clauses. A Horn clause is a logical statement of the form:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
E_1 \land E_2 \land \ldots \land E_k  \implies E_0
\end{align*}</div><p>It might be  shown that a set of Horn clauses, in conjunction, gives
rise to a polyhedron which, when relaxed, has all of its vertices binary.</p>
